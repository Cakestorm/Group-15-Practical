If x = y, then terminate as we have found our value. If not, then if x < y, recurse on the left child. Otherwise, recurse on the right. This gives us the location of y in O(log(n)) time.\n\n\n\n\nSome important uses of binary search trees in the ADS course include:\n\nRed-Black trees\nSplay trees", "updatedAt": 1714522197785}
