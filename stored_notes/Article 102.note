{"title": "Article 102", "body": "Intergeneric hybridization is an important strategy to introgress alien genes into common wheat for its improvement. But presence of cross ability barrier mechanism regulated by Kr1 gene played a major destructive role for hybridization than other reported genes. In order to know the underlying molecular mechanism and to dissect out this barrier, a new annealing system, ACP (anneling control primer) system was used in chromosome 5B (containing Kr1 gene) specific Recombinant Inbred Line (RIL) population. Two differentially expressed fragments for Kr1 gene was identified, cloned and sequenced. Further the expression was confirmed by northern blotting analysis. Sequence analysis of the resulted clones revealed classes of putative genes, including stress responsive and signal transduction.\n", "text": "Intergeneric hybridization is an important strategy to introgress alien genes into common wheat for its improvement.
