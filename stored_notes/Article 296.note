{"title": "Article 296", "body": "The paper presents the design and some results for an experimental platform aimed to control the air pressure inside a small tank. The basic idea is to allow to the control algorithm to select an appropriate characteristic of the controller driving the air compressor, from an available set. In this first approach, the goal is to make functional the hardware circuits and to design the software support inside an Integrated Development Environment with a Very High Level Programming Language. After some functional tests, future work is intended to implement artificial intelligent based algorithms in order to exploit the multicharacteristics features with a fuzzy decisions set for selecting an optimal control. The main parts of the controller are an industrial pressure sensor, a PIC (TM) 16F877 microcontroller from Microchip (TM) and the air pressure part consisting, mainly, from a car compressor and a small tank. Additional elements make the operation safe. The solution with the microcontroller is put in operation in parallel with another one, using an industrial digital controller from Honeywell (TM). The platform is intended both for research activities, dealing with all kind of control algorithms implemented in software, associated with pneumatic systems, and for academic purpose, joining in an unique structure sensors, microelectronics, interface techniques, industrial controllers, motors, pneumatic elements and software.\n", "text": "The paper presents the design and some results for an experimental platform aimed to control the air pressure inside a small tank.
