Here, we tested 1-tert-butoxy-4-chlorobenzene in a combined repeat-dose and developmental and reproductive toxicity test. The test chemical was administered daily by gavage to 9-week-old Crl:CD (SD) rats at doses of 0, 20, 100, and 500 mg/kg/d. Males were treated for 42 d beginning 14 d before mating. Females were treated from 14 d before mating to day 4 of lactation. Decreased spontaneous locomotion, decreased respiratory rate, and incomplete eyelid opening were observed at 500 mg/kg/d (both sexes), but resolved within 30 min of administration, suggesting central nervous system depression. No notable changes were observed in body weight, food consumption, functional battery tests, or blood test. Increased liver weight with centrilobular or diffuse hepatocyte hypertrophy was observed at 100 and 500 mg/kg/d (both sexes). There were no biochemical or histopathological changes related to hepatotoxicity. Increased kidney weight with basophilic tubules, tubule dilatation, and increased hyaline droplets were observed in males dosed at 100 and 500 mg/kg/d. Immunohistochemical staining indicated alpha(2u)-globulin nephropathy, a male rat-specific toxicity. Although kidney weight was also increased in females dosed at 500 mg/kg/d, it was not considered to be an adverse effect because there were no histopathological changes. Pup weights on postnatal day 0 were decreased at 500 mg/kg/d and still decreased on postnatal day 4. Our data indicated the no-observed-adverse-effect-level for repeated-dose and reproductive/developmental toxicity for 1-tert-butoxy-4-chlorobenzene was 100 mg/kg/d.\n"}]}, "text": "We have carried out animal toxicity tests of chemicals for a chemical safety program implemented by the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry of Japan.
