{"title": "Article 72", "body": "This article deals with the simulation of the power converter with voltage-source inverter and sine-filter. The repetitive control system was designed. The existing power converter has a control system which makes Fourier transform of the output voltage to inject these harmonics with opposite phase. The new proposed system based on repetitive controller which is much simpler and with smaller CPU load. The higher harmonics elimination works perfect and the power converter produces output voltage with less than 5% THD under linear or non-linear load. This paper describes the improved control system structure and its implementation in MATLAB Simulink environment. The advantages of the repetitive algorithm facing Fourier transform harmonic compensation are shown. The performance of the new control method is shown in simulation results. The algorithm is carried out in C language using MATLAB S-Function block so it is suitable for implementation in the real-time control systems.\n", "text": "This article deals with the simulation of the power converter with voltage-source inverter and sine-filter.
