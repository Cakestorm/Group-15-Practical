One should be able to easily and arbitrarily expand the feature set.\n\n\n\n\nA lightweight application: The app should be both easy and quick to install, and simple to learn. We wanted the app to be as similar to a WYSIWYG editor as possible, for ease of use, whilst still remaining powerful.\n\n\n\n\nAn intelligent feature set: The app should not just be a text editor simpliciter. In particular, we are targeting the app to an undergradute-and-up level; we must accommodate these users in our feature set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nprevious slide | next slide", "updatedAt": 1714677388790}
