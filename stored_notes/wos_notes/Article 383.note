{"title": "Article 383", "body": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), since its characterization as a precise form of dementia with its own pathological hallmarks, has captured scientists' attention because of its complexity. The last 30 years have been filled with discoveries regarding the elusive aetiology of this disease and, thanks to advances in molecular biology and live imaging techniques, we now know that an important role is played by calcium (Ca2+). Ca2+, as ubiquitous second messenger, regulates a vast variety of cellular processes, from neuronal excitation and communication, to muscle fibre contraction and hormone secretion, with its action spanning a temporal scale that goes from microseconds to hours. It is therefore very challenging to conceive a single hypothesis that can integrate the numerous findings on this issue with those coming from the classical fields of AD research such as amyloid-beta (A beta) and tau pathology. In this contribution, we will focus our attention on the Ca2+ hypothesis of AD, dissecting it, as much as possible, in its subcellular localization, where the Ca2+ signal meets its specificity. We will also follow the temporal evolution of the Ca2+ hypothesis, providing some of the most updated discoveries. Whenever possible, we will link the findings regarding Ca2+ dysfunction to the other players involved in AD pathogenesis, hoping to provide a crossover body of evidence, useful to amplify the knowledge that will lead towards the discovery of an effective therapy.
