{"body": "In whole cell patch-clamp recordings, we characterized the L-type Ca2+ currents in bovine adrenal zona fasciculata (AZF) cells and explored their role, along with the role of T-type channels, in ACTH- and angiotensin II (ANG II)-stimulated cortisol secretion. Two distinct dihydropyridine-sensitive L-type currents were identified, both of which were activated at relatively hyperpolarized potentials. One activated with rapid kinetics and, in conjunction with Northern blotting and PCR, was determined to be Ca(v)1.3. The other, expressed in approximately one-half of AZF cells, activated with extremely slow voltage-dependent kinetics and combined properties not previously reported for an L-type Ca2+ channel. The T-type Ca2+ channel antagonist 3,5-dichloro-N-[1-(2,2-dimethyl-tetrahydro-pyran-4-ylmethyl)-4-fluoro-piperidin-4-ylmethyl]-benzamide (TTA-P2) inhibited Ca(v)3.2 current in these cells, as well as ACTH- and ANG II-stimulated cortisol secretion, at concentrations that did not affect L-type currents. In contrast, nifedipine specifically inhibited L-type currents and cortisol secretion, but less effectively than TTA-P2. Diphenylbutylpiperidine Ca2+ antagonists, including pimozide, penfluridol, and fluspirilene, and the dihydropyridine niguldipine blocked Ca(v)3.2 and L-type currents and inhibited ACTH-stimulated cortisol secretion with similar potency. This study shows that bovine AZF cells express three Ca2+ channels, the voltage-dependent gating and kinetics of which could orchestrate complex mechanisms linking peptide hormone receptors to cortisol secretion through action potentials or sustained depolarization. The function of the novel, slowly activating L-type channel is of particular interest in this respect. Regardless, the well-correlated selective inhibition of T- and L-type currents and ACTH- and ANG II-stimulated cortisol secretion by TTA-P2 and nifedipine establish the critical importance of these channels in AZF cell physiology.\n", "embeddings": ["1.6308414", "0.53586704", "-0.7693501", "-0.7004093", "0.426287", "1.0171006", "-0.033082377", "0.8811261", "-0.4860981", "0.57722676", "-0.4338083", "-1.326729", "-0.75816536", "0.19465041", "-1.2205862", "-0.08199818", "0.101905175", "0.4107369", "-0.16749594", "0.9207779", "1.5307536", "0.7104908", "-1.6098442", "-1.5888449", "-1.2929602", "-0.43960115", "-0.32790968", "-0.16006503", "-1.2642161", "-0.37561446", "0.035151266", "1.0225184", "-0.80200094", "-1.2056392", "0.46313953", "-1.0890708", "0.1281051", "-0.45710394", "0.66952926", "-0.20541759", "1.3918097", "0.6844465", "0.08973789", "0.16727296", "0.5451499", "-0.91407675", "0.17050861", "-0.5217606", "2.3432102", "0.04711238", "-0.103957064", "0.53317744", "0.8247848", "0.15995365", "-0.6938366", "-1.0269039", "-0.6899371", "-1.3433813", "-2.203751", "2.038528", "-0.19866583", "1.4979353", "1.3857502", "1.0704079", "0.42503905", "1.5641118", "2.0997155", "0.3470314", "0.18943845", "0.368317", "0.9960084", "0.75104064", "-0.4945027", "0.40043637", "0.7420021", "0.623277", "1.4053575", "-2.1725585", "-0.14973238", "-0.002308437", "0.067617275", "-0.0778871", "-2.202122", "1.4542509", "-2.8955977", "-1.2517049", "0.048930142", "-0.055781294", "0.90980697", "1.8427917", "-0.31711033", "0.6563737", "-1.2551725", "-0.2830118", "1.7489464", "1.0824534", "-0.59918696", "-1.069174", "-0.8493024", "0.084900394", "-1.6953213", "-0.2708926", "0.9986212", "0.077901214", "0.17923205", "-0.7685529", "1.1318581", "1.4496458", "-0.96813554", "-0.84377146", "0.059666913", "-1.093765", "2.9580066", "-0.27911517", "0.28344294", "-1.1007967", "-0.8802212", "-0.2989326", "-1.5029327", "-0.24961558", "1.0611942", "0.8852621", "0.90030134", "0.3151418", "0.6842812", "-0.180756", "0.35004646", "0.3856418", "0.20828395", "-0.01704035", "0.85100937", "-0.80854005", "-0.64002657", "-1.0884966", "0.54798925", "-1.0353868", "-1.1817465", "0.3651305", "-1.2951335", "-0.59093875", "0.66071594", "-0.7991083", "0.5756595", "-0.5139911", "-0.0953279", "-0.41522178", "0.20837806", "0.09081239", "-1.2016958", "0.1761874", "0.36239973", "-1.787692", "-0.15007341", "0.63874006", "-0.70301175", "0.86037475", "-0.19472632", "0.47186252", "-0.0560653", "-0.3048777", "2.5881836", "0.56687737", "-0.74522924", "0.32363048", "-1.7554517", "-1.3777058", "1.2939204", "-0.31743464", "-0.7829712", "0.9287648", "-1.302494", "3.924164", "-0.5917219", "-1.0629352", "1.3528669", "-1.0217379", "-0.36536103", "0.14048149", "-0.5647285", "-0.6432486", "0.39671573", "0.7597848", "-0.7287394", "0.38795933", "-0.71213096", "-0.38202822", "-0.21475656", "-0.52194923", "1.5876062", "1.010278", "0.90759313", "0.7447251", "-0.74651486", "-0.14465016", "-0.10574094", "1.7749287", "1.1352986", "-0.54298747", "-1.0474726", "-0.3757035"]}
