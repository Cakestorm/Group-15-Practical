Loss-centrality and self-unclarity were associated with all three outcome measures, in cross-sectional analyses. Longitudinal analyses indicated that loss-centrality predicted symptom levels of prolonged grief, self-unclarity predicted symptom levels of depression, and both loss-centrality and self-unclarity were associated with posttraumatic stress 6 months after baseline.
