In 2012, 966(93%) of the positive samples were diagnosed by immunoglobulin M-based method and 73(7%) by nonstructural protein-1 antigen. In 2013, 4,401(76%) samples were tested positive by immunoglobulinM, 1,332(23%) by antigen and 58(1%) by polymerase chain reaction.

Conclusion: There was a shift in usage of direct virus identification for rapid diagnosis of dengue virus compared with host immunoglobulin M testing.\n"}]}, "text": "Objective: To evaluate the trends in usage of dengue virus diagnostics in Pakistan.
