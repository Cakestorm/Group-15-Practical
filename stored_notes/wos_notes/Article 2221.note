{"body": "Objective: To evaluate the trends in usage of dengue virus diagnostics in Pakistan. Methods: This retrospective study was conducted at the Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, and comprised data for specimens tested for dengue virus from January 2012 to December 2015. Test for dengue virus ribonucleic acid by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, dengue virus antigen by immunochromatic assay and for human immunoglobulin M against dengue virus by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were reviewed. SPSS 17 was used for data analysis. Results: Overall, 33,577 specimens tested for dengue virus. Of them, 11,995 (35.7%) were positive. among them, 1,039(8.66%) were reported in 2012; 5,791(48.28%) in 2013; 1,027(8.56%) in 2014; and 4,138(34.49%) in 2015. In 2012, 966(93%) of the positive samples were diagnosed by immunoglobulin M-based method and 73(7%) by nonstructural protein-1 antigen. In 2013, 4,401(76%) samples were tested positive by immunoglobulinM, 1,332(23%) by antigen and 58(1%) by polymerase chain reaction. The trend continued in 2014, but in 2015, 2,111(51%) of all dengue positive tests were determined by antigen testing, 1,969(47.6%) by immunoglobulin M and 58(1.4%) by polymerase chain reaction. Conclusion: There was a shift in usage of direct virus identification for rapid diagnosis of dengue virus compared with host immunoglobulin M testing.\n", "embeddings": ["0.9889251", "-0.16370419", "0.8855051", "-0.5452199", "0.36567217", "-0.4325871", "1.5674335", "0.23139137", "-0.69829786", "0.24094343", "-0.57652867", "-0.4052161", "0.4863335", "-0.25352678", "-0.737482", "-0.277437", "0.45890078", "0.5795616", "0.38582528", "-2.858775", "-0.6781622", "-0.518036", "0.69747233", "-0.26571548", "-1.5699897", "0.5973298", "0.6780504", "0.30435982", "-0.8091407", "-0.113560624", "1.048349", "0.9244619", "1.7464978", "-0.43903258", "-0.5756869", "-0.28684592", "-0.16056506", "-1.8446635", "0.14250384", "-1.168547", "-0.12813719", "0.9223595", "0.89512", "-0.81185734", "0.93115973", "-0.6020443", "0.005649437", "-0.29246163", "0.59431326", "-0.5402861", "1.4003513", "-0.36894894", "0.39580676", "-0.41103977", "1.3432764", "0.21962838", "0.22916399", "0.57530665", "0.39701277", "1.4192412", "0.93832916", "0.3708162", "-0.8568822", "0.14849588", "-0.71761036", "-1.1931487", "-0.29385906", "0.9216793", "-0.106361225", "1.562319", "0.69883996", "-0.675516", "0.75301063", "-0.9446917", "0.58381736", "0.3967594", "0.27782232", "-1.1629536", "-0.40744087", "0.13918656", "-0.05273946", "-1.026983", "0.73945916", "0.7028005", "0.35366857", "-0.15516855", "-1.5769961", "-0.6068619", "-0.023403948", "-1.1341416", "1.6409616", "-0.42016944", "0.7841886", "-1.297217", "0.8214875", "0.39574397", "0.84776646", "1.0292467", "0.95812124", "0.6962977", "0.8462545", "-0.57058316", "0.29169905", "0.69178784", "-1.3695468", "-0.7170895", "-0.4412166", "0.4178797", "-1.0488377", "-0.3422792", "-2.050202", "-0.37093097", "-0.46768332", "0.31238154", "0.61900705", "-0.34527624", "1.3173103", "-0.9104641", "-0.84724444", "-1.3355277", "0.0031555013", "0.48175195", "0.21605113", "0.5789232", "-0.91605663", "0.7687342", "-0.2114054", "-1.1380209", "-0.30536273", "-0.44086203", "0.652522", "0.5094686", "0.5145302", "-0.20005578", "0.0018420222", "-0.16685121", "0.33602726", "0.8605467", "0.55868274", "-0.4150254", "-1.3818798", "-1.0492998", "0.26399466", "0.7590943", "-0.837489", "-0.267808", "-0.27116805", "0.3181351", "-0.8044884", "-0.14358467", "-1.374832", "-0.1287399", "-0.817059", "0.2887257", "-0.049805544", "1.0917975", "0.35376468", "0.52995837", "0.3219259", "-0.64607006", "-0.41266018", "1.0721873", "0.07465113", "0.09352512", "-0.14307642", "0.020526666", "0.98438823", "-1.1356716", "-0.20303474", "-1.1041929", "-0.04373122", "0.6799255", "0.008288527", "-0.22339976", "1.275795", "0.51412654", "1.2858033", "-0.6983751", "1.9644558", "0.5981846", "0.42256653", "1.413896", "0.54122555", "0.62243307", "-1.3111762", "-1.2111571", "-0.5567731", "0.47168082", "1.7551225", "-0.80873585", "0.9115821", "-0.562323", "-0.8134669", "-0.44968972", "-0.48905802", "0.10930237", "-0.8916822", "-1.5345187", "0.07534129", "-0.29931363"]}
