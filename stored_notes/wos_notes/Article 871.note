We used CAR technology to redirect human polyclonal Tregs toward donor-MHC class I molecules, which are ubiquitously expressed in allografts.

CAR Tregs were specifically activated and significantly more suppressive than polyclonal or CAR Tregs in the presence of HLA-A2, without eliciting cytotoxic activity. Furthermore, CAR and CAR Tregs preferentially transmigrated across HLA-A2-expressing endothelial cell monolayers. In a human skin xenograft transplant model, adoptive transfer of CAR Tregs alleviated the alloimmune-mediated skin injury caused by transferring allogeneic peripheral blood mononuclear cells more effectively than polyclonal Tregs.
