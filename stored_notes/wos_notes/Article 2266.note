{"title": "Article 2266", "body": "Despite their superficial localization in the skin, pathogenic dermatophytes can induce a complex but still misunderstood immune response in their hosts. The cell-mediated immunity (CMI) is correlated with both clinical recovery and protection against reinfection, and CD4+ T lymphocytes have been recognized as a crucial component of the immune defense against dermatophytes. Before the discovery of the Th17 pathway, CMI was considered to be only dependent of Th1 cells, and thus most studies on the immunology of dermatophytosis have focused on the Th1 pathway. Nevertheless, the fine comparative analysis of available scientific data on immunology of dermatophytosis in one hand and on the Th17 pathway mechanisms involved in opportunistic mucosal fungal infections in the other hand reveals that some key elements of the Th17 pathway can be activated by dermatophytes. Stimulation of the Th17 pathway could occur through the activation of some C-type lectin-like receptors and inflammasome in antigen-presenting cells. The Th17 cells could go back to the affected skin and by the production of signature cytokines could induce the effector mechanisms like the recruitment of polymorphonuclear neutrophils and the synthesis of antimicrobial peptides. In conclusion, besides the Th1 pathway, which is important to the immune response against dermatophytes, there are also growing evidences for the involvement of the Th17 pathway.\n", "text": "Despite their superficial localization in the skin, pathogenic dermatophytes can induce a complex but still misunderstood immune response in their hosts.
