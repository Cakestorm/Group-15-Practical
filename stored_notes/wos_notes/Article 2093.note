{"body": "The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between methylation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2B (CDKN2B) CpG islands and telomerase activity in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). A total of 72 children with ALL and 12 children with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) were subjected to bone marrow aspiration and methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction analysis, and modified telomeric repeat amplification protocol assay analyses, to evaluate CDKN2B methylation and telomerase activity, respectively. The results of the present study demonstrated that, of these 72 children with ALL, 31 exhibited CDKN2B methylation at diagnosis (43.1%), whereas 41 exhibited no CDKN2B methylation (36.9%). However, no CDKN2B methylation was detected in the ITP controls. Furthermore, the mean level of telomerase activity was 39.52 +/- 39.33 total product generated (TPG) units in children with ALL, which was significantly increased compared with 2.49 +/- 2.27 TPG units in the ITP controls (P=0.002). The mean levels of telomerase were 49.09 +/- 44.43 and 29.99 +/- 32.43 TPG units in children with ALL with and without CDKN2B methylation, respectively (P=0.041), therefore children with ALL exhibited significantly increased levels of telomerase. The increased telomerase activity was significantly associated with increased risk of childhood ALL (P=0.023). A total of 22/31 children with ALL with methylated CDKN2B (71.0%) and 17/41 children with ALL with unmethylated CDKN2B (41.46%) exhibited increased telomerase activity (>15 TPG units). The results of the present study suggest that hypermethylation of CDKN2B CpG islands and hyperactivity of telomerase are common events in childhood ALL, and hypermethylation of CDKN2B CpG islands was significantly associated with upregulated telomerase activity (P=0.013).\n", "embeddings": ["0.8037096", "-1.2969601", "-0.3024317", "-0.61442745", "0.9142625", "-0.016908135", "0.7003881", "0.8172639", "-0.4714185", "1.1697559", "-1.2023191", "0.5190899", "0.65244865", "0.5859962", "-0.69815505", "-0.8649943", "-0.8787594", "0.36600217", "0.41163877", "-2.3258212", "1.1101909", "-2.7128906", "0.012321614", "-0.5375376", "0.19796099", "0.26523393", "-0.02961972", "0.45537314", "1.0391496", "-0.70409465", "1.638407", "-0.24431418", "1.5075376", "0.21253367", "0.8231734", "-0.4355596", "1.6203413", "0.551883", "-1.0768356", "0.1456154", "-1.2144563", "-0.38514453", "-1.1842297", "-0.7415515", "0.8529274", "-0.39359108", "0.37151462", "0.72027254", "-1.1568406", "-0.19816868", "0.5395588", "-0.96228683", "-0.41365352", "0.39393416", "-0.20306061", "0.58924335", "-0.43838236", "1.1337448", "0.41517535", "0.61892575", "-0.09733325", "-0.3302686", "-0.40716916", "0.90486366", "-1.3534313", "0.6622374", "1.1203172", "2.1765194", "0.5170018", "-0.5933096", "-0.90819275", "0.5369973", "0.31249493", "-0.070981935", "0.34259692", "1.1541911", "-0.16874798", "0.7808007", "-1.3378948", "0.1634514", "-0.46863708", "-0.2699907", "-1.0378464", "0.10573328", "-0.13355932", "-0.11245488", "-0.23509689", "0.44378072", "-1.5134414", "0.40073314", "1.8511356", "1.5936683", "1.7148085", "-1.0680933", "-0.017939085", "-0.76252383", "-1.1316835", "-1.0682305", "1.0715662", "-0.8634956", "2.2686658", "1.4273055", "-0.52283317", "0.46805364", "0.49166164", "-0.021235822", "-0.81639", "2.1126094", "-0.9071657", "-2.171556", "1.0582056", "-1.1804978", "1.288977", "0.1968591", "-0.4264171", "-0.92128956", "-0.9729423", "-0.7122983", "-0.5861504", "-0.16825268", "0.2815094", "0.73239666", "0.08649729", "-0.28665566", "-0.013617992", "-1.0179133", "0.17632261", "-0.9897148", "-0.1758806", "-0.6036914", "0.72944015", "-0.38618314", "0.95992786", "-1.3528696", "0.78738457", "-0.0062274416", "0.07478641", "0.021507313", "-1.1136943", "-1.1647938", "0.7472866", "1.3051409", "-1.0391799", "-0.6083094", "-0.33154336", "-2.309129", "0.40971082", "0.27300355", "-1.3615906", "1.6972629", "-0.21613224", "-0.6877239", "-0.53980005", "0.8125934", "-1.9111363", "1.2672951", "0.2977827", "-0.04147859", "0.28541973", "0.463427", "0.4786433", "2.6439173", "0.42729667", "0.8015821", "0.007924595", "0.70457923", "2.7454486", "-2.1350036", "-0.920593", "0.8276114", "0.018521335", "-0.971503", "1.9486233", "-1.5381333", "1.7233005", "-1.1369462", "0.9338983", "1.5123729", "1.9346598", "-1.2573712", "0.3358968", "0.49799672", "0.9110808", "0.7177331", "-0.34792325", "-1.4560996", "0.15487751", "-0.352751", "-0.03747677", "-1.4134889", "0.36636442", "0.498124", "-1.6291486", "-0.38127926", "2.417794", "-1.2993239", "-0.87309784", "-0.26915216", "-0.5926906", "-0.35157147"]}
