{"body": "Introduction: The high success rate in the management medulloblastoma achieved in the western world is not exactly mirrored in developing countries including India. Socio-demographic differences, health-care disparity, and lack in uniformity of care with resultant widespread variations in the clinical practice are some of the reasons that may partly explain this difference in outcomes. Patients with medulloblastoma require a multi-disciplinary team approach involving but not limited to neuro-radiology, neurosurgery; neuropathology, molecular biology, radiation oncology, pediatric medical oncology and rehabilitative services for optimizing outcomes. Methods: The Indian Society of Neuro-Oncology (ISNO) constituted an expert multi-disciplinary panel with adequate representation from all stakeholders to prepare national consensus guidelines for the contemporary management of medulloblastoma. Results: Minimum desirable, as well as preferable though optional recommendations (as appropriate), were developed and adopted for the pre-surgical work-up including neuroimaging; neurosurgical management including surgical principles, techniques, and complications; neuropathology reporting and molecular testing; contemporary risk-stratification in the molecular era; appropriate adjuvant therapy (radiotherapy and chemotherapy); and follow-up schedule in medulloblastoma. Conclusions: The current document represents a broad consensus reached amongst various stakeholders within the neuro-oncology community involved in the contemporary curative-intent management of children with medulloblastoma. It provides both general as well as specific guidelines and recommendations to be adopted by physicians and health care providers across India to achieve uniformity of care, improve disease-related outcomes, and compare results between institutions within the country.\n", "embeddings": ["-0.15038162", "-0.97908366", "1.3258978", "1.6380057", "-0.5705603", "-0.57029694", "0.72105956", "0.19084378", "0.075391605", "-1.6186936", "0.57436085", "-1.4489863", "0.40870848", "-0.2413008", "-0.58775884", "-0.14584136", "0.6046718", "0.18314995", "1.0493567", "-1.5012175", "0.47160852", "-1.1897255", "-0.22940224", "0.07578518", "0.64426285", "-0.9045168", "0.3339057", "-0.07564353", "-1.3873345", "-0.43621498", "-0.44941288", "0.9713725", "2.0715332", "-0.5457821", "0.75157744", "-0.73815495", "-0.35688868", "0.015401156", "1.4608196", "-1.9957478", "-0.2518128", "-0.97290826", "-0.12093382", "0.16463254", "0.8030691", "-0.8453888", "-0.39760193", "0.4975636", "-0.3661952", "0.3428121", "-0.7863775", "-0.004259633", "-0.8880527", "-0.5890465", "0.121915944", "-1.3156927", "1.0701582", "0.37626958", "0.15430939", "0.6193984", "-0.30046394", "0.77006", "0.020858139", "-1.5246919", "-1.1924936", "-0.21549909", "-0.9619516", "2.0420563", "-1.1038283", "-0.29737774", "0.06545135", "-0.992482", "-0.73253196", "0.45461553", "0.07818885", "0.9899558", "0.053666446", "1.0262446", "-0.4637925", "-1.6149006", "0.55758256", "0.53297424", "-1.1011623", "1.338859", "-1.072401", "-0.0900284", "-0.91634566", "-0.75820667", "-0.42573857", "1.2675225", "1.2442917", "0.42239088", "-0.7877589", "0.36293265", "4.1342225", "1.3867419", "-0.38839757", "0.25358075", "-0.94769114", "0.07321627", "0.501359", "-0.09355537", "-0.42813388", "2.2777514", "0.5835551", "-3.3282962", "-0.98072386", "2.3930929", "-2.664371", "-0.26714897", "2.237651", "0.25923046", "-0.34570825", "0.10901019", "1.435484", "0.21943726", "0.25013548", "-1.64196", "-0.63257885", "-1.7379456", "0.34991422", "1.1127049", "0.4540667", "-0.2856414", "0.35053396", "0.008664784", "-1.7860484", "-0.1838739", "1.6450135", "-0.65521926", "0.43089595", "-0.34036765", "-0.6392213", "-1.0408705", "0.94007105", "1.1613199", "-0.27300146", "0.6559519", "0.2554389", "0.017236508", "-0.72081697", "1.195191", "1.2354976", "-1.1801558", "-0.9086906", "0.006923286", "1.9390424", "0.18334287", "0.6690263", "0.08798014", "-0.5381399", "0.46313056", "0.10385052", "-1.8483399", "-1.2724686", "-0.20218773", "-1.0713284", "-0.14709386", "-1.2841864", "1.0510902", "0.27802244", "1.4793864", "0.78638256", "-0.42131588", "0.69634664", "1.3783062", "-0.2788584", "-0.1979974", "-0.56512517", "0.86525834", "-0.6946577", "-0.6383066", "0.41965115", "-0.8844798", "0.80576503", "1.4322355", "-0.51252085", "2.0072136", "2.2707105", "-1.0470055", "0.4334056", "1.3970968", "-0.08806368", "-0.07954485", "0.86770386", "0.7403025", "-0.11337706", "0.50627095", "1.5149565", "-0.13992095", "1.2193826", "1.2203314", "-0.7807859", "0.12414088", "2.413389", "0.5422162", "-1.1894467", "0.46037957", "-0.42622215", "-0.10220491"]}
