{"body": "Objective: In flammation may contribute to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in HIV-1 infection. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in the regulation of inflammation. In treated HIV-1-infected individuals, we aimed to identify differentially expressed miRNAs with known roles in inflammation and CVD risk and to investigate associations between these and systemic inflammation. Methods: In a screening cohort including 14 HIV-1-infected individuals and 9 uninfected controls, microarray profiling was performed using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Differentially regulated miRNAs previously related to inflammation and CVD were validated using real-time quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction in 26 HIV-1-infected individuals and 20 uninfected controls. Validated miRNAs were measured in PBMCs, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), cytomegalovirus immunoglobulin G, lipids, and fasting glucose were measured, and associations with validated miRNAs were assessed with multiple linear regression analysis. Results: Upregulation of miR-210, miR-7, and miR-331 was found in PBMCs from HIV-1-infected individuals when compared with those from uninfected controls (P, 0.005). In contrast, miR-210 and miR-331 were downregulated in CD8(+) T cells. In multivariate analysis, miR-210 in CD8(+) T cells was negatively associated with LPS (P = 0.023) and triglycerides (P = 0.003) but positively associated with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (P = 0.004). MiR-7 in PBMC was positively associated with interleukin-6 (P = 0.025) and fasting glucose (P = 0.005), whereas miR-331 was negatively associated with LPS (P = 0.006). In PBMCs from HIV-1-infected individuals with low cytomegalovirus immunoglobulin G, miR-7, miR-29a, miR-221, and miR-222 were downregulated. Conclusion: In 2 independent cohorts, miR-210, miR-7, and miR-331 were differentially regulated in treated HIV-1-infected individuals and associated with markers of systemic inflammation.\n", "embeddings": ["0.5444643", "-0.6899119", "-1.1722337", "-0.18671976", "0.16485684", "0.4731123", "-0.026407067", "3.6418142", "0.44836378", "-0.964621", "-0.52137387", "0.34841773", "0.9702596", "0.63245875", "-2.816249", "0.10408934", "1.2448685", "0.9584274", "-0.31730428", "-2.1103299", "0.4893195", "-1.1218554", "0.9067778", "0.6300076", "1.419444", "-0.047494993", "0.47431582", "0.46854246", "0.063205436", "-0.53648543", "0.16625956", "0.9154339", "0.5734865", "0.44867262", "0.3278596", "-0.2927827", "1.9592386", "-2.3800347", "1.9590657", "0.03187168", "-0.7933206", "-0.5838796", "-2.3904324", "-1.8222007", "0.066254735", "-1.0275449", "0.35384238", "-0.80697507", "0.93740606", "-0.3550119", "1.096238", "-0.70544225", "-0.9887642", "-1.6758193", "0.8612053", "1.2954142", "-1.0051844", "0.300778", "-1.5922155", "0.1388556", "-0.6174064", "0.5893115", "1.1750338", "0.13176127", "1.1125257", "1.0944256", "0.45332316", "1.7665334", "-0.36894235", "-0.8085886", "-0.45158008", "1.0320404", "-0.6395616", "1.0099149", "1.0123843", "1.5082139", "-0.3881978", "-0.74354285", "-1.3453584", "0.63351226", "0.7844795", "0.684601", "0.3882663", "2.7334425", "-1.7379001", "0.80360967", "-0.40513316", "0.1296553", "0.32446843", "-0.4149201", "1.6528623", "0.39564246", "-0.16645753", "-0.5629508", "0.35227707", "-1.4254932", "1.3910779", "-1.5601996", "-0.40033403", "0.7494117", "-1.5996021", "0.84224576", "0.61018765", "-1.3072144", "-1.450183", "-0.73983335", "0.2759525", "0.6599542", "0.75112754", "-1.2931802", "-1.2784454", "-0.7702618", "-0.53098804", "-1.1278445", "0.41526744", "-0.6658535", "0.71403426", "-1.8801708", "-0.49002647", "-0.20132624", "-0.33429155", "-0.0012066937", "0.07863725", "-1.0983273", "0.8242905", "-0.3505143", "-0.6128822", "-0.1457907", "-0.20833312", "1.014347", "-0.5505921", "-0.9629551", "0.3517157", "-1.4944878", "1.1523325", "-0.75519824", "-0.70252997", "-1.3308855", "1.0281775", "-1.7688811", "-1.3488092", "-0.1265308", "1.0162302", "-0.64585394", "2.2483943", "-0.76712334", "-0.100621104", "0.5060123", "-0.6100987", "1.5691291", "0.813537", "0.43584523", "0.5961182", "0.38674077", "-0.56202334", "0.17842229", "1.8096074", "1.5028173", "0.23326911", "-0.5651162", "-0.21377382", "0.75061613", "0.40581763", "0.87337214", "-0.25669757", "1.628532", "0.23292072", "0.36876675", "-0.72005326", "0.34891382", "-0.67938477", "1.0375078", "0.06311225", "-1.6119807", "0.75821954", "0.02523765", "-0.43686977", "-1.0523257", "1.6196748", "-0.70546734", "-0.2166599", "0.2903297", "0.41669402", "0.49082428", "-0.27826405", "-0.14258748", "-1.4598918", "-0.7664522", "-0.15362394", "0.45346558", "0.7132426", "0.0944563", "-1.2115937", "-0.6171886", "0.19727504", "-0.48084033", "0.14644207", "-1.4196025", "0.17299004", "-0.88172376"]}
