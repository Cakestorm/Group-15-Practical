Recently, serrated polyps were classified into three subtypes, consisting of hyperplastic polyp, SSA/P, and traditional serrated adenoma, according to the World Health Organization classification. It has been suggested that SSA/P in the proximal colon are a precursor lesion of pathogenesis of colorectal cancer and are characterized by BRAF mutation and a CpG island methylator phenotype with or without microsatellite instability. However, SSA/P is more challenging to detect by colonoscopy and is likely to account for some interval cancers, particularly in the proximal colon because it presents flat or sessile, isochroous appearance, and occasionally has a mucous cap.

It is important for gastroenterologists to recognize the endoscopic features of serrated polyps to facilitate their detection and removal and also to establish postpolypectomy surveillance guidelines.
