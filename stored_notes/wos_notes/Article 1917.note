{"title": "Article 1917", "body": "This paper proposes a predictive control algorithm that includes conduction-mode detection for power factor correction (PFC) converter. In PFC converters, the line current is usually distorted because of the characteristics of the proportional-integral (PI) current controller. To improve the quality of the current, the PI current controller requires additional circuits or algorithms. However, because of the optimal duty cycle determined by estimating the next-state current in both the continuous-conduction mode and the discontinuous-conduction mode, the proposed predictive control method has a fast dynamic response and accuracy compared to the PI current-control method. Moreover, the proposed algorithm can detect the conduction mode without any additional circuitry or mode-detection algorithm using the characteristic of the optimal duty cycle calculated by the predictive control. These advantages of the proposed algorithm improve the quality of the line current for PFC converters. We verify the proposed method by performing experiment using a 1.5-kW PFC converter.\n", "text": "This paper proposes a predictive control algorithm that includes conduction-mode detection for power factor correction (PFC) converter.
