{"body": "Background: A number of mosquito vectors bite and rest outdoors, which contributes to sustained residual malaria transmission in endemic areas. Spatial repellents are thought to create a protective \"bubble\" within which mosquito bites are reduced and may be ideal for outdoor use. This study builds on previous studies that proved efficacy of transfluthrin-treated hessian strips against outdoor biting mosquitoes. The goal of this study was to modify strips into practical, attractive and acceptable transfluthrin treated sisal and hessian emanators that confer protection against potential infectious bites before people use bed nets especially in the early evening and outdoors. This study was conducted in Kilombero Valley, Ulanga District, south-eastern Tanzania. Results: The protective efficacy of hand-crafted transfluthrin-treated sisal decorative baskets and hessian wall decorations against early evening outdoor biting malaria vectors was measured by human landing catches (HLC) in outdoor bars during peak outdoor mosquito biting activity (19: 00 to 23: 00 h). Treated baskets and wall decorations reduced bites of Anopheles arabiensis mosquitoes by 89% (Relative Rate, RR = 0.11, 95% confidence interval, CI: 0.09-0.15, P < 0.001) and 86% (RR = 0.14, 95% CI: 0.11-0.18, P < 0.001), respectively. In addition, they significantly reduced exposure to outdoor bites of Culex spp. by 66% (RR = 0.34, 95% CI: 0.22-0.52, P < 0.001) and 56% (RR = 0.44, 95% CI: 0.29-0.66, P < 0.001), respectively. Conclusion: Locally hand-crafted transfluthrin-treated sisal decorative baskets and hessian wall decorations are readily acceptable and confer protection against outdoor biting malaria vectors in the early evening and outdoors: when people are resting on the verandas, porches or in outdoor social places such as bars and restaurants. Additional research can help support the use of such items as complementary interventions to expand protection to communities currently experiencing outdoor transmission of mosquito-borne pathogens.\n", "embeddings": ["-0.3743636", "-0.8542116", "0.78220206", "-0.7456489", "0.6697653", "-1.6578445", "0.2314564", "-0.3344025", "-1.9521413", "0.8470092", "-2.1492248", "-1.9650893", "-2.1925788", "0.4713998", "-1.0140065", "-2.1530352", "-0.11006971", "-0.3387666", "0.05930254", "-1.7332051", "-0.34321687", "-0.4301483", "0.60001755", "1.9405452", "-0.6519726", "-0.24678503", "0.51991725", "-0.57905203", "0.14105596", "-0.44280824", "1.1030054", "1.4776531", "-1.3854233", "0.039580606", "0.20939402", "0.40322834", "-0.11165264", "1.2197832", "-0.15081783", "-1.9033307", "-1.327199", "0.645416", "0.12422993", "-0.600943", "0.51793313", "-0.7862113", "-2.2624962", "0.57170355", "-0.583316", "0.4884384", "-1.4590042", "-0.2750357", "1.0778055", "-1.3167496", "0.7185703", "-0.54798883", "0.49550346", "2.695739", "0.9077736", "2.285218", "0.12284041", "-0.31687623", "-1.4232464", "1.0814422", "-0.969678", "-1.8522053", "0.57638294", "4.0358768", "-1.3663932", "-0.3124576", "0.39551395", "0.4230055", "0.39403835", "-0.3307308", "-0.9129437", "0.9738482", "-0.99266005", "-0.16781996", "-1.7003522", "1.1952791", "0.58306444", "-0.42720506", "1.131487", "2.2695196", "-0.52530926", "-0.6831333", "3.3305416", "-0.40040278", "-1.4750768", "-0.20144525", "-1.4229127", "1.5772741", "1.3053359", "0.64326197", "-0.09025066", "-0.8823257", "-1.5604532", "-1.9543687", "0.35152125", "-0.027467998", "-0.4676036", "2.0250537", "-0.24098203", "0.6014996", "-2.4658055", "0.407565", "-0.55070966", "0.57579696", "-0.9337191", "-1.8060576", "-0.3699621", "1.039283", "-1.1256261", "0.29685682", "-0.81083184", "1.0287707", "0.314705", "-3.0635324", "-0.6472441", "-1.247802", "-0.9961998", "0.015094922", "-0.24677937", "0.5380023", "1.1979765", "-1.0502714", "0.23051989", "0.3363377", "-0.624302", "-2.1957655", "1.1803517", "-0.82243186", "1.4317654", "-0.98816574", "0.7790987", "-0.084858574", "-1.7954372", "-0.79114056", "0.8041527", "-0.20205472", "-0.7632738", "0.43150023", "-1.0613106", "-0.4091024", "1.0807259", "0.7242597", "-0.32798043", "0.076951794", "-0.16535589", "0.457384", "0.6739994", "-0.16030578", "1.0605526", "1.9512731", "-1.9127834", "-1.0069658", "0.6186968", "-0.038580745", "-0.5204471", "-0.23558293", "-1.0827874", "0.69494206", "-1.3254691", "1.7406589", "1.2823952", "0.49816588", "1.6074127", "-1.7922204", "-1.8770925", "-0.73131174", "0.71402293", "-0.20420067", "-1.1374667", "1.616346", "-0.05918899", "0.9664001", "-0.9440624", "1.7506186", "1.258339", "1.073094", "-1.2432816", "2.091838", "-1.2284762", "-0.55996174", "0.013954884", "0.60293686", "-2.425952", "0.43101266", "1.4659882", "1.3135962", "0.21682708", "0.51389146", "0.84175354", "0.33290392", "0.003846815", "0.06823038", "-1.3554245", "-1.37062", "-0.2806957", "1.2355727"]}
