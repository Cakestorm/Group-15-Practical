{"title": "Article 662", "body": "Two newly established canine histiocytic sarcoma (HS) cell lines, designated as PWC-HS01 and FCR-HS02, were obtained from brain and articular tumors, respectively. These 2 HS cell lines had phagocytic ability and modal chromosome aberrations. Although morphologic features of both HS cells were similar, immunocytochemical examinations revealed that the PWC-HS01 cell line expressed both dendritic cell (ie, S100, CD208, CD1, and CD4) and macrophage (ie, CD68, CD163, and CD204) markers. In contrast, the FCR-HS02 cell line was immunonegative for CD204 and CD68 but consistently positive for the dendritic cell markers. Moreover, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analyses confirmed histiocytic differentiation of both HS cell lines. These results suggest that HS from the central nervous system may have a tendency to be more undifferentiated compared with cases from other organs. In addition, the 2 newly established HS cell lines were also tumorigenic and metastatic in immunodeficient mice, supporting that these cell lines can be used as new tumor models for investigating canine histiocytic diseases.\n", "text": "Two newly established canine histiocytic sarcoma (HS) cell lines, designated as PWC-HS01 and FCR-HS02, were obtained from brain and articular tumors, respectively.
