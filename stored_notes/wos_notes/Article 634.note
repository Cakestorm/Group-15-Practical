{"title": "Article 634", "body": "Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) has become a routine and robust technique for measuring the expression of genes of interest, validating microarray experiments and monitoring biomarkers. However, concerns have been raised over the accuracy of qRT-PCR in China as well as in the rest of the world. We have previously used qRT-PCR to study the response of ANR1 and other root-expressed MADS-box genes to fluctuations in the supply of nitrate, phosphate and sulphate under hydroponic growth conditions. In this study, we have used both Northern blotting and qRT-PCR analyses to confirm the nutritional regulation of MADS-box genes in Arabidopsis thaliana and test whether both technologies produce the same results. The information obtained indicated that the qRT-PCR results are consistent with those obtained by Northern blotting hybridization for all the tested root-expressed MADS-box genes, in response to different nitrate, phosphate and sulphate growth conditions. Furthermore, our novel results showed that the expressions of AGL12, AGL18, and AGL19 were all down regulated in response to S and P re-supply in both qRT-PCR and Northern blotting analyses.\n", "text": "Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) has become a routine and robust technique for measuring the expression of genes of interest, validating microarray experiments and monitoring biomarkers.
