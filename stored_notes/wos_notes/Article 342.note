{"title": "Article 342", "body": "Background: Leukotoxin (Ltx) expressed by Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans is a powerful exotoxin, which can cause imbalance in host response. Immunoreactivity to Ltx is a marker for presence of leukotoxic A. actinomycetemcomitans, a presence that may modify the disease pattern of colonized individuals. The aim of the present study is to examine presence of systemic immunoreactivity to A. actionmycetemcomitans Ltx with respect to clinical and inflammatory findings in individuals with or without periodontitis (N = 88). Methods: Periodontal status was examined in patients with severe periodontitis (n = 49) and healthy controls (n = 39), and patients received periodontal treatment. Systemic biomarkers associated with inflammation and infections as well as clinical parameters were analyzed at baseline and 3 and 6 months after treatment. Results: Presence of immunoreactivity against Ltx was associated with impaired remission of disease after periodontal treatment. This immunoreactivity was also significantly associated with increased systemic levels of A. actinomycetemcomitans-specific immunoglobulins and increasing age. Conclusion: Presence and levels of systemic immunoreactivity against A. actinomycetemcomitans Ltx are associated with decreased remission after otherwise successful periodontal treatment.\n", "text": "Background: Leukotoxin (Ltx) expressed by Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans is a powerful exotoxin, which can cause imbalance in host response.
