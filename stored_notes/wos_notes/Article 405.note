{"title": "Article 405", "body": "A cDNA sequence OsMT3 was initially isolated from the subtractive cDNA library of ammonium-fed rice (Oryza sativa L.) leaves, which was further confirmed by Northern blot to be highly ammonium-up-regulated as compared to nitrate. Its full-length cDNA was cloned by RT-PCR, and in silico analysis reveals that the cDNA includes an open reading frame of 186 bp and encodes a rice metallothionein type 3 peptide. Northern blotting analysis showed that OsMT3 gene predominantly expressed in rice leaves, weakly in stems, and barely in buds and roots. The gene transcripts in leaves were significantly induced by polyethylene glycol (PEG), low temperature, NaCl and Cu2+, but not by Pb2+. Activities of three anti-oxidative enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase and peroxidases) and two non-enzymic antioxidants (reduced ascorbate and reduced glutathione) little differed in ammonium-and nitrate-fed rice leaves, indicating that the induced OsMT3 expression was not mediated by ammonium-elicited oxidative signals.\n", "text": "A cDNA sequence OsMT3 was initially isolated from the subtractive cDNA library of ammonium-fed rice (Oryza sativa L.) leaves, which was further confirmed by Northern blot to be highly ammonium-up-regulated as compared to nitrate.
