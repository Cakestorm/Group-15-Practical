{"title": "Article 400", "body": "Aminoacylase 1 (ACY1) is important for regulating the proliferation of numerous types of cancer. However, the expression and mechanisms underlying the function of ACY1 in colorectal cancer remain unclear. In order to investigate the expression and function of ACY1 in colorectal cancer, tumor tissue and blood samples were collected for analysis from 132 patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis and western blotting identified significantly increased expression of ACY1 mRNA in colorectal tumor tissue (P<0.05 vs. adjacent normal tissue) and notably increased ACY1 protein levels. This ACY1 mRNA expression was found to be positively correlated with tumor stage. In addition, plasma ACY1 concentration was increased in patients with colorectal cancer compared with healthy controls. Furthermore, in vitro knockdown of ACY1 in human colorectal cancer HT-29 cells was shown to inhibit proliferation and increase apoptosis. This effect was found to be associated with the activation of ERK1 and TGF-beta 1 signaling. In conclusion, the results of the present study suggest that ACY1 promotes tumor progression, and thus may be a potential target for the diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer.\n", "text": "Aminoacylase 1 (ACY1) is important for regulating the proliferation of numerous types of cancer.
