{"title": "Article 2569", "body": "Second-order generalised integrator or resonant integrator (RI) has wide range of applications. Forward and backward Euler's approximation based two integrator realisation of RI is an easily implementable frequency adaptive method.

In this study, multi-rate computation-based implementation of two integrator-based RI has been proposed to minimise resonant frequency deviation. In this method, no additional logic elements are consumed to achieve accurate resonant frequency location. This along with down-sampling leads to lesser phase lag of RI. The effect of quantisation on resonant frequency deviation has been analysed for proper choice of calculation time.
