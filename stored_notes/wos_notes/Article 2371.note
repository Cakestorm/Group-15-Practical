The two simple strategies, \"glass-PDMS-glass\" sandwich configuration and surfactant-doped surface modification, are used to enhance PCR compatibility and enable efficient amplification in the chip by minimizing water loss and nonspecific adsorption of protein.

We evaluated the quantitative capabilities of the dPCR chip by measuring a ten-fold serial dilution of genomic DNA from lung cancer cell line H1975.
