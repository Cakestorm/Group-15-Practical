{"body": "BACKGROUNDStereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for localized prostate cancer involves high-dose-per-fraction radiation treatments. Its use is increasing, but concerns remain about treatment-related toxicity. The authors assessed the incidence and predictors of a global decline in health-related quality of life (HRQOL) after prostate SBRT. METHODSFrom 2008 to 2014, 713 consecutive men with localized prostate cancer received treatment with SBRT according to a prospective institutional protocol. Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC-26) HRQOL data were collected at baseline and longitudinally for 5 years. EPIC-26 is comprised of 5 domains. The primary endpoint was defined as a decline exceeding the clinically detectable threshold in 4 EPIC-26 domains, termed multidomain decline. RESULTSThe median age was 69 years, 46% of patients had unfavorable intermediate-risk or high-risk disease, and 20% received androgen-deprivation therapy. During 1 to 3 months and 6 to 60 months after SBRT, 8% to 15% and 10% to 11% of patients had multidomain declines, respectively. On multivariable analysis, lower baseline bowel HRQOL (odds ratio, 1.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-2.7; P < .01) and baseline depression (odds ratio, 5.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-24.3; P = .02) independently predicted for multidomain decline. Only 3% to 4% of patients had long-term multidomain declines exceeding twice the clinical threshold, and 30% of such declines appeared to be related to prostate cancer treatment or progression of disease. CONCLUSIONSProstate SBRT has minimal long-term impact on multidomain decline, and the majority of more significant multidomain declines appear to be unrelated to treatment. This emphasizes the importance of focusing not only on the side effects of prostate cancer treatment but also on other comorbid illnesses that contribute to overall HRQOL. Cancer 2017;123:1635-1642. (c) 2017 American Cancer Society. In a cohort of over 700 patients with prospective health-related quality-of-life information, prostate stereotactic body radiation therapy has minimal long-term impact on clinically detectable declines in global quality of life. Baseline poor bowel function and clinical depression are associated with an increased rate of multidomain decline.\n", "embeddings": ["-1.1870972", "-1.1559011", "0.074119665", "1.5395114", "0.76561", "-0.70491123", "-2.5864418", "2.1847007", "-2.209606", "0.73517305", "-0.56441313", "-0.35200936", "2.0104823", "-0.42385396", "-2.616208", "-0.5549786", "0.9390879", "-0.27944595", "0.18498415", "-2.9826496", "-0.7089385", "-1.3482349", "2.0069444", "-0.27449515", "0.9746604", "-0.86631066", "0.4739256", "-0.16440013", "-1.1101985", "1.4215055", "-0.6730688", "0.31862983", "1.0608239", "0.41528347", "-0.05939709", "1.4053704", "0.58017176", "0.1416056", "2.3777027", "-0.36959675", "-1.3115319", "-0.25618517", "-0.6686141", "-0.8124274", "1.0196733", "-0.847594", "-0.6235064", "1.1883281", "0.19837444", "-0.13361622", "-0.09373502", "0.123877406", "-1.5942796", "2.0182393", "0.252174", "1.78409", "-0.82264346", "-1.0365701", "-0.14061694", "-0.9720259", "-0.76047003", "0.84714586", "-0.117990084", "-1.0070992", "-1.6133581", "0.30812818", "-0.11443221", "-0.33942014", "-0.50129116", "1.5508397", "0.42475894", "0.024141632", "0.36884874", "1.1104616", "-0.014833619", "2.0669122", "0.004338775", "-1.1056879", "-1.077081", "-1.6139035", "-0.05443308", "-0.9239038", "0.48775023", "0.12001924", "-1.3845652", "0.15813771", "-0.7698382", "-0.75131845", "0.12198253", "-2.4895256", "2.5980482", "0.5936327", "2.1632073", "1.9317156", "1.9313058", "-1.7233121", "-0.4136682", "1.048058", "0.13261959", "-0.7337612", "-0.45793104", "0.3448936", "0.19312777", "0.3533905", "-0.6475183", "-1.8510675", "1.8885688", "0.80142933", "-0.70811", "-0.48196104", "-0.43470514", "0.034672022", "-1.0338421", "-0.3326411", "-0.52364725", "-0.056771964", "-0.0004064396", "-0.2894761", "-2.6837049", "0.34240338", "-0.5629667", "-0.46453997", "0.09394384", "1.4581345", "0.4114379", "-0.08936211", "1.8181522", "0.45352194", "2.3100681", "1.0537004", "0.8685183", "1.4380987", "1.0770168", "0.8608975", "1.4080452", "1.16244", "1.6941916", "-1.2157185", "0.011508899", "-0.28014565", "0.07934722", "-0.085492216", "-1.2082082", "0.099804096", "-1.29352", "0.37657353", "-0.27945742", "-1.3006445", "0.85156804", "0.96097964", "2.1108336", "-0.15927027", "-1.8287004", "-0.13414884", "-2.1638198", "0.6480364", "0.5018429", "1.8228937", "1.1474892", "-0.89223546", "0.30472106", "0.6173518", "0.9995459", "-0.04232102", "-0.1735127", "-0.2658249", "0.04045294", "0.25232205", "0.37639228", "-0.56689584", "-0.41001543", "-1.0147862", "-0.88131535", "0.5930899", "-1.3231355", "0.35048407", "-0.2723284", "1.2904477", "0.03109112", "-0.6416742", "1.1379219", "1.3498638", "-0.69004256", "-1.2119892", "1.9170351", "-0.037898008", "-0.15534306", "1.6121418", "1.9227176", "-0.8888427", "1.0105864", "-0.5642121", "-0.6244467", "-2.2348263", "-0.25406647", "-0.9497993", "-0.26382816", "-1.0647529", "-1.0526843", "-0.6853498"]}
