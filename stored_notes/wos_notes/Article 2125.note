{"title": "Article 2125", "body": "Purpose: To study the effects of topical ganciclovir 0.15% gel on cytomegalovirus (CMV) anterior uveitis in a tertiary uveitis referral center in Brussels, Belgium. Methods: A retrospective study of patients with a clinical diagnosis of CMV anterior uveitis/endotheliitis demonstrated by a positive polymerase chain reaction and/or Goldmann-Witmer coefficient (GWc). Results: We report a series of 15 patients presenting clinical characteristics of CMV anterior uveitis. Patients had a pretreatment follow-up of 13.00 +/- 12.78 months and a posttreatment follow-up of 42.64 +/- 31.23 months. The 14 non-Asian patients (93.3%) had clinical characteristics of Posner-Schlossman syndrome, and the only Asian patient (6.7%) had keratic precipitates like Fuchs heterochromic iridocyclitis. At presentation, uveitis was unilateral in all patients, visual acuity (VA) was 0.91 +/- 0.25, and all patients had an increased intraocular pressure (IOP), with a mean IOP of 41.40 +/- 10.35 mmHg. At the end of the follow-up, 5 patients (33.3%) had glaucoma, 2 needed glaucoma surgery (13.3%). The mean final VA was 0.93 +/- 0.11; 13 patients (86.5%) reached a final VA of 0.7 to 1. Patients had a significantly lower number of recurrences/year posttreatment (0.76 +/- 0.57) than in the pretreatment period (3.76 +/- 2.44) (P = 0.001). The mean time to recurrence increased from 4.03 months before treatment to 12.58 months after treatment (P = 0.003). Conclusion: Our results suggest that patients treated with 0.15% topical ganciclovir have a decreased frequency of CMV anterior uveitis recurrences, most preserve a relatively good central vision over time. However, glaucoma is a frequent and severe complication.\n", "text": "Purpose: To study the effects of topical ganciclovir 0.15% gel on cytomegalovirus (CMV) anterior uveitis in a tertiary uveitis referral center in Brussels, Belgium.
