{"title": "Article 2055", "body": "Development of renewable power generation systems (RPGSs) is continually increasing worldwide with Germany, China, Japan, Italy and the USA are the leaders contributing to the largest, development in each region. Due to the increasing number of RPGSs connected to the utility grid, power quality, safe operation, and islanding protection of RPGSs are becoming important issues, among others. One of the most important elements is the current control technique that must meet the requirements for grid interconnection according to international standards and practices. The RPGS itself must be safe and highly efficient for reliable and secure grid interconnection operations. This paper presents a review of the state-of-the-art of the current control techniques for three-phase grid-interconnection of RPGSs. Several current control architectures, their operations including advantages and disadvantages were discussed. Performance comparison and evaluation of several controllers were also reviewed.
