{"title": "Article 2104", "body": "Two genotypes showing differential immunity against Karnal bunt (Tilletia indica) were used to investigate the role of three members of cystatin gene family in growth stage dependent immunity in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Three members of cystatin gene family (WC1, WC2, and WC4) were cloned and sequenced. Analysis of sequenced data showed that there was 76-99% nucleotide and protein sequence identity between different genes of the wheat cystatin. In silico amino acid sequence analysis revealed the presence of a conserved signature pattern of residues and also the functional domains were presumed to be actively involved in imparting cysteine protease inhibition capability. The semi-quantitative and quantitative levels of these members were measured by means of RT-PCR, northern blotting, western blotting, and by ELISA techniques. The members of cystatin gene family were expressed in both resistant (HD 29) and susceptible genotypes (WH 542); however, the expression level was significantly (P0.05) in contrary to WC1 family whose expression gradually increased from S-v to S-2 stage. According to the intensity of the detected band in RT PCR, northern blot and western blot, WC1 family seems to be expressed more than the other gene families. The immunoassay results further showed that WC1 protein was abundantly expressed in resistant genotype and high expression was observed at the S2 stage as compared to susceptible genotype (P < 0.001) suggesting that low level of expression of WC1 in S2 stage is responsible for KB infection. The results of the present study clearly indicate the role of cystatin gene family in differential and stage dependent immunity against KB.\n", "text": "Two genotypes showing differential immunity against Karnal bunt (Tilletia indica) were used to investigate the role of three members of cystatin gene family in growth stage dependent immunity in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.).
