The use of the simulation tool THERMAS give us the opportunity to investigate all the appropriate parameters that affect system's efficiency based on exergy analysis while incorporating a detailed parametric analysis regarding the whole system. The optimization process relies on the difference between the energy and exergy efficiency by considering an innovative Optimization Factor (OPF) for each simulated system, which is dynamically affected by operational parameters, such as fuel composition, extension of chemical reactions and temperatures.
