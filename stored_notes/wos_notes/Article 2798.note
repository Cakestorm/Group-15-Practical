Psychological measures of anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Y-STAI-Y) and depression (Beck Depression Inventory-BDI) were also collected, and a usability questionnaire was administered. Significant correlations were observed between the \"paper and pencil\" screening of working memory abilities and the ET-based neuropsychological measures.

Further studies will be aimed at investigating validity and usability components in neurological populations with motor-verbal impairments.\n"}]}, "text": "Traditional cognitive assessment in neurological conditions involving physical disability is often prevented by the presence of verbal-motor impairment; to date, an extensive motor-verbal-free neuropsychological battery is not available for such purposes.
