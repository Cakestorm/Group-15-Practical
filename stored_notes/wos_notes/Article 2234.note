{"body": "Depression is a major health problem in which oxidative stress and inflammation are inextricably connected in its pathophysiology. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is an important anti-oxidant compound with anti-inflammatory and neuro-protective properties. This study was designed to investigate the hypothesis that CoQ10 by its anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory potentials can alleviate depressive- like behavior by restoring the balance of the tryptophan catabolites kynurenine/serotonin toward the serotonin pathway by down-regulation of hippocampal indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO-1). Depressive-like behavior was induced by chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) protocol including food or water deprivation, cage tilting, reversed light cycle etc. Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups; Control, CUMS, CUMS and CoQ10 (50,100 and 200 mg/kg/day i.p. respectively) groups. CoQ10 effects on different behavioral and biochemical tests were analyzed. CoQ10 showed significant antidepressant efficacy, as evidenced by significantly decreased stress induced changes to forced swimming challenge and open field test, as well as attenuating raised corticosterone level and adrenal glands weight. The anti-oxidant effect of CoQ10 was exhibited by its ability to significantly reduce hippocampal elevated malondialdehyde and 4-hydroxynonenal levels and elevate the reduced glutathione and catalase levels. CoQ10 significantly reduced different pro-inflammatory cytokines levels including interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-2, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. It suppressed hippocampal IDO-1 and subsequent production of kynurenine and enhanced the hippocampal contents of tryptophan and serotonin. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that CoQ10 was able to attenuate the elevated microglial CD68 and elevate the astrocyte glial fibrillary acidic protein compared to CUMS group. CoQ10 exhibited antidepressant-like effects on rats exposed to CUMS. This could be attributed to its ability to reduce IDO-1 leading to shift the balance of the Kynurenine/ serotonin toward the serotonin pathway.\n", "embeddings": ["0.5536824", "-2.251086", "-2.4064384", "0.14910765", "1.5385454", "-0.29956087", "-0.6459666", "1.5589545", "-1.2801036", "1.0681175", "-0.5613938", "-1.5832956", "-2.2725387", "2.0095022", "-0.9188831", "-1.5686002", "0.18264621", "-0.73848957", "0.038522433", "-2.649362", "0.49412346", "-0.7701435", "0.6438396", "0.91834694", "0.4577463", "1.1155995", "1.5944874", "-0.43051338", "-1.5909742", "-0.32312065", "0.77545035", "0.4978521", "-0.290867", "-0.5516672", "-0.626179", "1.0640241", "0.45591256", "1.1114764", "-1.6705073", "0.8165142", "-0.41688666", "0.4186317", "-1.1662464", "-0.4460748", "-0.31895065", "0.009524608", "0.15375404", "0.78769904", "1.0588857", "-0.05211939", "2.048838", "0.31596947", "0.55861807", "-1.3923463", "-0.93837434", "0.49658862", "-0.9884538", "-0.80156547", "-1.5339233", "0.6388429", "-0.09547126", "-0.022058427", "0.76547635", "0.115677245", "-1.5290934", "0.6275114", "0.3503466", "0.76671994", "0.06443344", "1.1147212", "-1.092255", "1.2876726", "1.3229339", "1.1052567", "-0.39679122", "1.3730953", "1.4471322", "-0.77738696", "-1.6457449", "-0.21430282", "0.33014697", "-0.92934686", "-1.4870191", "2.7041767", "0.6754078", "-0.1093685", "1.4603363", "-0.39559305", "-1.915363", "0.13725255", "0.19048388", "0.4636672", "0.3439456", "1.3998104", "-1.679744", "0.42993745", "-0.25189665", "-0.17211014", "-0.06643367", "-0.49601942", "0.44193143", "0.0792668", "1.0625553", "-0.06750817", "-1.0396073", "0.6656187", "0.97902626", "0.01756607", "-0.04968955", "-1.4349462", "0.48776215", "-1.9822087", "-2.5147724", "-0.86623687", "-0.4965896", "-1.439592", "0.49916813", "-2.6189847", "-0.40919596", "-0.046631347", "0.56558186", "0.9103894", "0.4549342", "0.08356254", "1.3790652", "-0.19503087", "-0.596402", "-0.26796016", "-0.38027978", "-0.7761734", "0.6372926", "0.67572874", "-1.5679286", "-1.2176262", "1.4920479", "0.64469767", "-0.45075786", "1.7498637", "-0.8527241", "-0.4965449", "0.964573", "1.21139", "-0.71813065", "0.116607204", "0.051184904", "1.4236039", "-0.3089926", "-0.2489312", "0.09461214", "1.2680357", "-0.0018963093", "-1.5870099", "-0.03770574", "1.2349983", "-1.4307971", "1.3428235", "1.1897581", "0.72796696", "-0.3052218", "-1.5391247", "1.2000527", "1.8219261", "-0.00800233", "-0.33269617", "-1.4015458", "-1.9184339", "0.63301843", "0.6548403", "0.91488415", "-1.0453501", "0.0047644656", "2.033269", "0.037100084", "-0.9269393", "-1.6401461", "-1.3694111", "0.9467405", "0.5798791", "-0.5151983", "-1.8107698", "-0.47279507", "-0.9770419", "0.2538025", "-0.9865308", "0.53396225", "0.30130503", "0.8047362", "2.2953174", "-0.7298757", "1.2119185", "-1.4999535", "0.11720251", "-1.7713368", "-0.090665765", "-0.8956082", "-0.05978975", "-0.3109643", "1.9244112", "-0.10836923", "0.21226759"]}
