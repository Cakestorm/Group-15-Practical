{"title": "Article 1640", "body": "Background: In cat visual cortex, critical period neuronal plasticity is minimal until approximately 3 postnatal weeks, peaks at 5 weeks, gradually declines to low levels at 20 weeks, and disappears by 1 year of age. Dark rearing slows the entire time course of this critical period, such that at 5 weeks of age, normal cats are more plastic than dark reared cats, whereas at 20 weeks, dark reared cats are more plastic. Thus, a stringent criterion for identifying genes that are important for plasticity in visual cortex is that they show differences in expression between normal and dark reared that are of opposite direction in young versus older animals. Results: The present study reports the identification by differential display PCR of a novel gene, alpha-chimaerin, as a candidate visual cortex critical period plasticity gene that showed bidirectional regulation of expression due to age and dark rearing. Northern blotting confirmed the bidirectional expression and 5'RACE sequencing identified the gene. There are two alternatively-spliced alpha-chimaerin isoforms: alpha 1 and alpha 2. Western blotting extended the evidence for bidirectional regulation of visual cortex alpha-chimaerin isoform expression to protein in cats and mice. alpha 1- and alpha 2-Chimaerin were elevated in dark reared compared to normal visual cortex at the peak of the normal critical period and in normal compared to dark reared visual cortex at the nadir of the normal critical period. Analysis of variance showed a significant interaction in both cats and mice for both alpha-chimaerin isoforms, indicating that the effect of dark rearing depended on age. This differential expression was not found in frontal cortex. Conclusions: Chimaerins are RhoGTPase-activating proteins that are EphA4 effectors and have been implicated in a number of processes including growth cone collapse, axon guidance, dendritic spine development and the formation of corticospinal motor circuits. The present results identify alpha-chimaerin as a candidate molecule for a role in the postnatal critical period of visual cortical plasticity.\n", "text": "Background: In cat visual cortex, critical period neuronal plasticity is minimal until approximately 3 postnatal weeks, peaks at 5 weeks, gradually declines to low levels at 20 weeks, and disappears by 1 year of age.
