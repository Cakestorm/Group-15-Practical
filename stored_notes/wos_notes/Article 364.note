The control algorithm, implemented in a microprocessor, requires feedback from motor currents, and the quality of this feedback is essential to a drive's control properties. Motor phase currents are sampled and processed in order to extract their mean over a digital control interval.

The field-oriented frame rotates continuously, but in practice the transformation is carried out using a discrete angular position. This paper investigates how the discretization impacts the computed field-oriented currents in high speed drives, where the rotor displacement during a control interval is substantial. A continuous-time model of field-oriented currents is indicated as a reference to quantify errors. An original approach to normalize variables and to solve the model analytically is proposed in order to investigate how the errors related to rotor position discretization are influenced by drive operating conditions. The analytical solution is validated by computer simulation. The results show that the currently applied methodology of computing field-oriented current components, due to an invalid assumption, introduces errors of a few percent when a drive operates at high speed.
