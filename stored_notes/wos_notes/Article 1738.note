These vaccines could be used both in an outbreak setting and to provide long-term protection in populations at risk of sporadic outbreaks. A number of vaccines have been evaluated in phase 1 trials, but the two most advanced first-generation Ebola vaccine candidates are the live replicating vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) and the replication-defective chimpanzee adenovirus 3 (ChAd3). This review focuses on these two vaccines in clinical development and discusses the future opportunities and challenges faced in the licensure and deployment of Ebola virus vaccines.
