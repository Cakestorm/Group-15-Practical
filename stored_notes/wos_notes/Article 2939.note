{"body": "Aims: This study explored the sex-specific associations between friendship trust and the psychological well-being of young Swedes from late adolescence to early adulthood. Methods: A random sample of native Swedes born in 1990 was surveyed at age 19 years and again at age 23 years regarding their own well-being and their relationships with a maximum of five self-named peers. The response rate was 31.3%, resulting in 782 cases to be analysed. We used sex-stratified structural equation models to explore the associations between trust and well-being. Psychological well-being was constructed as the latent variable in the measurement part. The structural part accounted for the autocorrelation of trust with respect to well-being over time and incorporated the cross-lagged effects between late adolescence and early adulthood. Results: It was found that trust increased while well-being decreased for young men and remained stable for young women from 19 to 23 years of age. The young women reported lower well-being at both time points, whereas no sex difference was found for trust. Based on model fit comparisons, a simple model without forward or reward causation was accepted for young men, whereas reversed causation from well-being to trust was suggested for young women. Subsequent analysis based on these assumptions confirmed the reversed effect for young women. Conclusions: The findings suggest that young people do not benefit from trustful social relations to the same extent as adult populations. Young women who express impaired well-being run a greater risk of being members of networks characterized by low friendship trust over time.\n", "embeddings": ["0.19589363", "-0.21459313", "-0.986121", "1.1584274", "-0.6168663", "-0.7256184", "-0.65543616", "2.763023", "-1.4861983", "-0.43720046", "-0.14346142", "0.23157969", "0.56986547", "-0.6576222", "0.16648039", "0.5353221", "0.083401896", "0.4059748", "1.0771735", "-0.18648116", "-0.89809453", "1.3910375", "-0.95030123", "-0.4221713", "1.8616233", "0.17605567", "-1.6318424", "-0.13934104", "1.254591", "0.040843826", "-0.08822227", "-0.7602594", "0.4785267", "-0.95484585", "-0.36339125", "-0.07169306", "-0.5023183", "0.039684054", "-1.0818071", "-0.13218568", "0.09485382", "1.0748225", "-0.55208576", "-1.5092174", "1.2467622", "-2.1282637", "-0.86738884", "-0.084667824", "-0.07716582", "-0.60809445", "-0.29375178", "-1.6432302", "-0.47686774", "-1.6387326", "-0.17707445", "-0.03744413", "-0.61245024", "-0.3509415", "-1.6045475", "0.15763506", "-0.31321084", "-0.058599398", "-0.04478205", "0.74831134", "-0.4953017", "2.231968", "0.7585196", "0.20679407", "1.8965036", "1.1343112", "1.0353464", "0.8464345", "1.4681658", "0.35656044", "-0.7323977", "-0.3332225", "0.94144225", "-1.7585505", "-0.51490504", "-0.8402122", "0.20988882", "-1.7706923", "-1.2962595", "0.7570799", "-1.8329575", "0.33423758", "0.68950117", "1.6829704", "-1.5791644", "0.66884696", "1.7174345", "1.6453737", "2.2350235", "0.42439798", "0.7504195", "0.26327366", "0.4698662", "-1.2760952", "-0.012864533", "1.4106171", "0.7219438", "-0.5461897", "0.43520766", "-0.1725036", "0.021459462", "-1.553561", "0.44170085", "-0.35361812", "-0.4534521", "-0.81504387", "-1.033184", "-0.29378614", "0.22988218", "0.7495355", "-0.6032924", "-0.64491135", "1.3309859", "-2.4679492", "-0.11840627", "-0.77978665", "-0.49303487", "0.9196043", "0.18155959", "-1.5853941", "-0.21996659", "0.9595657", "0.3077907", "-0.09413168", "0.7196563", "-0.3282891", "2.1871307", "-0.6338576", "-0.21219228", "0.2984265", "-0.5103474", "1.6621678", "-0.8017055", "0.48354423", "-0.027530907", "-0.5822981", "-0.52209544", "0.47329876", "0.4731792", "-1.2818727", "0.95712644", "-0.7567957", "-0.06495407", "0.51174206", "0.4363336", "0.023258034", "-1.0322704", "-0.45721954", "-1.0757604", "0.27312818", "-0.3420602", "0.42855456", "-0.26793936", "-0.51114243", "1.4171118", "0.1262291", "-0.55018157", "-0.1702265", "-0.23440781", "-0.6639671", "1.8872359", "2.0755348", "0.912739", "-1.3942189", "-1.4350855", "1.4298121", "1.6092913", "-0.20073295", "0.92829543", "-0.41536754", "0.88123804", "-0.75398505", "-0.87552434", "-1.7299014", "0.3830775", "-0.45961577", "-1.3345866", "0.7116475", "1.1100624", "1.1167182", "0.8913487", "0.57620317", "-0.35200393", "0.32716563", "0.3025019", "2.3781374", "0.7663274", "-0.33094388", "1.1192162", "1.6952897", "1.109298", "0.7917436", "1.1936673", "-0.9575804", "-0.75333756", "0.4806797"]}
