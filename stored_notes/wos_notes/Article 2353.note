{"title": "Article 2353", "body": "In order to get a thorough understanding of the total digital silicon micro-gyroscope, a novel system-level model with details of both the sense and circuit is presented in this paper. Unlike the traditional structures of the digital part of the digital gyroscope, a structure with programmable delay units (PDUs) instead of DPLLs gives a brief and robust character of the whole system. And the PDUs coordinating with the FIR filter could lead to a removal of the IF filters of the sigma delta DAC for feedback, which saves a lot of consumption. Two MASH sigma delta ADCs are designed to convert the output of the charge voltage converters to digital signals, which also bring a better stability. The ADCs achieve an SNR of 102.5 dB with a 10 kHz bandwidth. The stabilization of the closed drive mode has also been analyzed including how the noise caused by the quantization of the digital circuit is affecting the stabilization of both the amplitude and frequency of the driving signals. In the end, a final result of simulation of the gyroscope shows the correctness and accuracy of the whole model of the gyroscope.\n", "text": "In order to get a thorough understanding of the total digital silicon micro-gyroscope, a novel system-level model with details of both the sense and circuit is presented in this paper.
