{"title": "Article 1192", "body": "Breast cancer is the second most common cause of mortality in women; therefore, the identification of novel putative markers is required to improve its diagnosis and prognosis. Selenium is known to protect mammary epithelial cells from oxidative DNA damage, and to inhibit the initiation phase of carcinogenesis by stimulating DNA repair and apoptosis regulation. Consequently, the present study has focused attention on the selenoprotein family and their involvement in breast cancer. The present study performed a global analysis of the seleno-transcriptome expression in human breast cancer MCF-7 and MDA-MB231 cell lines compared with healthy breast MCF-10A cells using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The present data revealed the presence of differently expressed genes in MCF-7 and MDA-MB231 cells compared with MCF-10A cells: Four downregulated [glutathione peroxidase (GPX) 1, GPX4, GPX5 and GPX7] and three upregulated (deiodinase iodothyronine, type II, GPX2 and GPX3) genes. Additionally, interactomic investigation were performed by the present study to evaluate the association between the downregulated and upregulated genes, and to identify putative HUB nodes, which represent the centers of association between the genes that are capable of direct control over the gene networks. Network analysis revealed that all differentially regulated genes, with the exception of selenoprotein T, are implicated in the same network that presents three HUB nodes interconnected to the selenoprotein mRNAs, including TP53, estrogen receptor 1 and catenin-beta 1 (CTNNB1). Overall, these data demonstrated for the first time, a profile of seleno-mRNAs specific for human breast cells, indicating that these genes alter their expression on the basis of the ER-positivity or negativity of breast cancer cells.\n", "text": "Breast cancer is the second most common cause of mortality in women; therefore, the identification of novel putative markers is required to improve its diagnosis and prognosis.
