{"title": "Article 2793", "body": {"ops": [{"insert": "ADAMTS-like 2 (ADAMTSL2), is a secreted protein resembling the ancillary domains of the ADAMTS proteases, but with distinct structural features. It has 7 thrombospondin type-1 repeats (TSRs), but an unusually long spacer module, which in both humans and mice, contains a novel insertion bearing six N-glycosylation sites. The ADAMTSL2 protein expressed in HEK293F and COS-I cells, is a cell-surface and extracellular matrix binding glycoprotein, with N-linked carbohydrate constituting similar to 20% by mass. The 4.0 kb Adamtsl2 mRNA is found most abundantly in adult mouse liver, lung and spleen by northern blotting. During mouse embryogenesis, Adamtsl2 was expressed most strongly in the third week of gestation. Adamtsl2 mRNA was detected by in situ hybridization in developing skeletal muscle, liver, bronchial and arterial smooth muscle, skin, intervertebral disc, perichondrium, pancreas and spinal cord. Immunohistochemical localization of ADAMTSL2 protein was similar to mRNA expression. Detection of Adamtsl2 mRNA and protein in developing skeletal myotubes, but not undifferentiated myogenic precursors led us to investigate its regulation during in vitro myogenic differentiation. In C2C12 and 23A2 myogenic cells, but not in 23A2 cells rendered non-myogenic by expression of G12V:H-Ras (9A2 cells), differentiation induced by serum starvation triggered expression of Adamtsl2 mRNA, coordinately with Myog, a marker of muscle differentiation. Furthermore, activation of the key myogenic determinant MyoD in 10T1/2 fibroblasts also triggered expression of Adamtsl2 mRNA. Collectively, the data suggest that induction of Adamtsl2 mRNA is an integral feature of myogenesis. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V./International Society of Matrix Biology.
