Gene-expression profiling analysis of breast cancer cells, semi-quantitative RT-PCR, Northern blotting and Western blotting confirmed RQCD1 to be frequently up-regulated in breast cancer specimens and breast cancer cell lines. On the other hand, its expression was very weak or hardly detectable in normal human tissues except testis, indicating this molecule to be a novel cancer-testis antigen. Treatment of breast cancer cell lines with siRNA targeting RQCD1 drastically suppressed cell proliferation. Concordantly, introduction of exogenous RQCD1 into HEK293 cells significantly enhanced cell growth, implying RQCD1 to have an oncogenic activity. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments and immunocytochemical staining revealed an interaction of RQCD1 protein with Grb10 interacting GYF protein I (GIGYF1) and 2 (GIGYF2) proteins, involved in regulation of Akt activation, in breast cancer cells. Interestingly, knockdown of either of RQCD1, GIGYF1 or GIGYF2 resulted in significant reduction of the phosphorylation of Akt at Ser 473 in breast cancer cell lines. Our findings suggest that RQCD1 is a potential molecular target for treatment of breast cancer.\n"}]}, "text": "We here report identification and characterization of Required for Cell Differentiation I homolog (RQCD1) as a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer.
