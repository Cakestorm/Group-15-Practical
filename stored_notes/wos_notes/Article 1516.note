{"title": "Article 1516", "body": {"ops": [{"insert": "Aim: To assess plasma levels of cortisol and cytokines between cocaine-dependent women with and without childhood maltreatment (CM) history during cocaine detoxification treatment. Method: We assessed immunoendocrine and clinical parameters of 108 crack cocaine female users during 3 weeks of inpatient detoxification treatment, and 24 healthy women to obtain reference values. Women with (CM+, n = 53) or without (CM-, n = 55) CM history were identified answering the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). Blood samples and clinical assessment were collected before lunch during the first, second and third week post-treatment admission. Flow cytometry was used to assess TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17A plasma levels and ELISA assay was used to measure plasma cortisol levels. Results: At baseline, lower Th1 and Thl 7-related cytokines levels and higher Th2 cytokines levels were observed in crack cocaine users compared with reference values. Cytokines levels of cocaine dependents gradually became closer to reference values along detoxification treatment. However, when CM+ and CM groups were compared, increased levels of IL-6, IL-4 and TNF-alpha across time were observed in CM+ group only. Additionally, a Th1/Th2 immune imbalance was observed within CM+ group, which was negatively correlated with the severity of the crack withdrawal. Finally, loading trauma exposure severity, immunoendocrine and clinical parameters in factor analysis, we identified three clusters of observed variables during detoxification: (1) systemic immunity and trauma exposure, (2) pro-inflammatory immunity and (3) behavior Conclusion: Our results suggest the existence of an immunological phenotype variant associated with CM exposure during crack cocaine detoxification of women.
