{"title": "Article 881", "body": "Treatment of perpetrators is tried and tested albeit little researched for the prevention of recidivism in domestic violence in Germany. This study investigated the evidence of batterer programs on the risk of domestic violence recidivism and the risk of child maltreatment reported by fathers on 161 perpetrators of domestic violence. Based on the indicators for a high risk for reassault that were confirmed in international longitudinal studies, a risk inventory for domestic violence was developed and implemented in three German program sites. A shortened German version of the Child Abuse Potential Inventory and the Interpersonal- Reactivity- Index were used for perpetrators' self report. The study showed that the child abuse potential of program dropouts was significantly higher compared to program completers at baseline (n = 92). Longitudinal results showed significant improvements with moderate effect sizes in all risk indicators assessed by specialists (n = 78) and battered women (n = 44). Perpetrators' self report on cognitive empathy improved too (n = 62). However, selfreported risk of child maltreatment did not change (n = 46). No evidence of selective questioning of victims was found. A classification of the results as well as the implications for the treatment of perpetrators and research on recidivism in Germany are discussed.\n", "text": "Treatment of perpetrators is tried and tested albeit little researched for the prevention of recidivism in domestic violence in Germany.
