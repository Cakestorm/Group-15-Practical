{"title": "Article 552", "body": {"ops": [{"insert": "Objective: Arginine-specific cysteine proteases (Rgps) from Porphyromonas gingivalis are important virulent factors of periodontal diseases. However, there is no therapeutic drug that inhibits proinflammatory events induced by these enzymes. In this study, we investigated proinflammatory activities of Rgps and activated coagulation factor X (FXa) and examined the effect of DX-9065a, a new selective inhibitor of FXa, on proinflammatory events induced by these proteinases. Methods: Human gingival fibroblasts were stimulated with Rgps and FXa in the presence or absence of DX-9065a, and then interleukin-6 (IL-6) and matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) release, their mRNA expression, and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) activation were assessed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), northern blotting, and a gel-mobility shift method, respectively. Results: Rgps and FXa activated IL-6 and MMP-1 release in human gingival fibroblasts through their amidolytic activities and in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and NF-kappa B dependent manners. DX-9065a inhibited FXa-mduced IL-6 mRNA expression and NF-kappa B activation. DX-9065a inhibited amidolytic activities of FXa and Rgps in vitro and ex vivo. Conclusion: Rgps and FXa are potent inflammatory mediators and DX-9065a may be a useful therapeutic drug for periodontal disease.\n"}]}, "text": "Objective: Arginine-specific cysteine proteases (Rgps) from Porphyromonas gingivalis are important virulent factors of periodontal diseases.
