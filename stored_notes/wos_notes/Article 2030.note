{"body": "Structural and molecular properties of antidepressants 1-(3-(dimethylamino)propyI)-1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydroisobenzofuran-5-carbonitrile were examined using quantum mechanics of Density Functional Theory (DFT)/B3LYP and PBEPBE methods with 6-311 ++G(d,2p) and LanL2DZ basis sets to study the therapeutic properties of the drug. For this, the structure of desired material was optimized by the computer calculation method and with the use of powerful Gaussian 09 software. Then the lowest energy value and the bond length, bond angle and dihedral angle between its constituent atoms in the crystal structure of the desired material were measured from the optimized values. Then the amount of positive and negative charges, polarizability and dipole moment of its atoms using Mulliken charge and Natural atomic charges, DFT/B3LYP and PBEPBE methods with 6311 ++ G(d,2p) and LanL2DZ basis sets were determined and the results were compared with each other for individual atoms and by mentioned methods. Also the type of stretching vibrations and bending vibrations between the constituent atoms of the molecule were specified using mentioned computational methods and FT IR vibrational spectra. The experimental spectrum of this material was taken to determine the functional groups and the computational and experimental values were compared to each other and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) was used to specify the isomer shift between the carbons and protons in the presence of polar and non polar solvents. Also Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) was used to determine the type of electron transfers in (sigma ->sigma* and pi ->pi* and LP(1) ->sigma* and LP(2) sigma* and the amount of hardness and softness in molecule was determined using the difference between ionization energy and electron affinity energy in constituent atoms of that molecule in the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and in the presence of solvents H2O, CH3CN and C6H12. UV-Vis spectrum of the drug was taken using DFT/B3LYP and PBEPBE methods with 6-311 ++ G(d,2p) and LanL2DZ basis sets as well as solvents H2O, CH3CN and C6H12 and the associated transmissions were examined.
