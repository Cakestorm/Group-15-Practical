Then the amount of positive and negative charges, polarizability and dipole moment of its atoms using Mulliken charge and Natural atomic charges, DFT/B3LYP and PBEPBE methods with 6311 ++ G(d,2p) and LanL2DZ basis sets were determined and the results were compared with each other for individual atoms and by mentioned methods. Also the type of stretching vibrations and bending vibrations between the constituent atoms of the molecule were specified using mentioned computational methods and FT IR vibrational spectra. The experimental spectrum of this material was taken to determine the functional groups and the computational and experimental values were compared to each other and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) was used to specify the isomer shift between the carbons and protons in the presence of polar and non polar solvents. Also Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) was used to determine the type of electron transfers in (sigma ->sigma* and pi ->pi* and LP(1) ->sigma* and LP(2) sigma* and the amount of hardness and softness in molecule was determined using the difference between ionization energy and electron affinity energy in constituent atoms of that molecule in the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and in the presence of solvents H2O, CH3CN and C6H12.
