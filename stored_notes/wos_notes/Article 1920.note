{"title": "Article 1920", "body": {"ops": [{"insert": "Expectation of reward can be shaped by the observation of actions and expressions of other people in one's environment.

In twenty-three healthy human subjects, we isolated effects of first-hand experience, other people's choices, and the mediating effect of their confidence, on decision-making and neural correlates of value within ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC).
