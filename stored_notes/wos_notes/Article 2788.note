{"title": "Article 2788", "body": "In mammals, 10 isoforms of fatty acid-binding protein (FABP) are expressed in various tissues. To understand the role of multiple FABP isoforms, we have quantitatively examined the transcript levels of individual FABP isoforms in each of various tissues by Northern blotting using synthesized RNAs corresponding to the mRNA of each isoform as external standards. As a result, absolute transcript levels of individual FABP isoforms expressed in each tissue were successfully determined. The 10 FABP isoforms were classified into three categories: (1) isoforms FABP7 and 12 were not markedly expressed in any tissue examined; (2) isoforms showing certain transcript levels in multiple tissues; and (3) isoforms FABP6, 8, and 9, expressed at certain levels in one particular tissue. Based on the expression profiles of the isoforms, individual tissues were also classified into three groups: (1) tissues in which high-level expression of FABP isoforms was not observed, (2) tissues in which multiple FABP isoforms were expressed at certain levels, and (3) tissues in which a single FABP isoform was dominantly expressed at a certain level. These results give a better understanding of the meaning of the presence of multiple FABP isoforms in mammals.\n", "text": "In mammals, 10 isoforms of fatty acid-binding protein (FABP) are expressed in various tissues.
