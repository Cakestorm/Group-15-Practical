{"body": "Immunodeficient mice play a critical role in hematology research as in vivo models of hematopoiesis and immunology. Multiple strains have been developed, but hematopoietic stem cell engraftment and immune reconstitution have not been methodically compared among them. Four mouse strains were transplanted with human fetal bone marrow or adult peripheral blood CD34(+) cells: NSG, NSG-3GS, hSCF-Tg-NSG, and hSIRP alpha-DKO. Hematopoietic engraftment in the bone marrow, blood, spleen, and liver was evaluated by flow cytometry 12 weeks after transplant. The highest levels of human engraftment were observed in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow, whereas peripheral blood cell chimerism was notably less. The highest levels of tissue engraftment were in hSCF-Tg-NSG mice, but NSG mice exhibited the highest blood leukocyte engraftment. hSCF-Tg-NSG mice also exhibited the highest levels of CD133(+)CD34(++) stem cells. hSIRPa-DKO engrafted poorly and exhibited poor breeding. Myelopoiesis was greatest in NSG-3GS mice, followed by hSCF-Tg-NSG and NSG mice, whereas B cell engraftment exhibited the opposite pattern. Engraftment of CD3(+) T cells, CD3(+)CD161(+)T cells, and CD3(-)CD56(+) NK cells was greatest in NSG-3GS mice. Mast cell engraftment was highest in hSCF-Tg-NSG mice, but was also elevated in spleen and livers of NSG-3GS mice. Basophils were most abundant in NSG-3GS mice. Overall, hSCF-Tg-NSG mice are the best recipient mice for studies requiring high levels of human hematopoiesis, stem cell engraftment, and an intermediate level of myelopoiesis, whereas NSG and NSG-3GS mice offer select advantages in the engraftment of certain blood cell lineages.\n", "embeddings": ["0.51235485", "0.5427417", "-0.41210255", "-0.29282847", "1.9590467", "0.42298737", "0.750921", "2.1781514", "-0.06605257", "0.061902653", "-1.7316802", "-0.27012652", "0.6859146", "-0.01725688", "-1.1683084", "0.36845165", "-1.1950781", "1.6198545", "0.5580743", "-2.6381779", "-0.9671674", "-1.0804257", "0.794639", "-0.5049508", "-1.6072633", "-1.0909538", "-0.07683698", "-0.848547", "-0.8737988", "0.39737192", "1.8653053", "-0.08121645", "1.5615878", "1.2054781", "2.3155892", "0.12529805", "-0.16536169", "-0.007854842", "0.16999117", "-0.45494965", "-0.23910888", "0.75138825", "-1.252983", "-0.44906226", "1.0641891", "-0.021432526", "0.2930022", "0.8261267", "-0.079028115", "-1.4208455", "1.1540807", "-1.2364025", "0.552104", "-0.5234781", "-1.2090338", "1.0747781", "0.6356175", "1.4045466", "-0.52401847", "0.4301538", "-0.04514605", "0.21167295", "0.0013855865", "-0.82745117", "-1.1504472", "-0.73072284", "1.1970516", "0.66496855", "-0.6285315", "-1.0778694", "0.61792785", "0.62745434", "-0.9729771", "-0.32388026", "-1.6234151", "-0.14176738", "0.24245316", "-0.13122725", "-0.8787976", "-0.58137447", "-0.13190307", "-1.2819343", "-0.987303", "0.12245894", "-2.371212", "0.49643278", "-0.7164087", "-0.6773192", "-0.79420954", "1.9283072", "0.60477424", "1.9517329", "0.390876", "0.0038136845", "1.6865633", "-0.58349514", "-1.1587735", "-0.24176162", "1.3335326", "0.26020998", "0.25523144", "-0.85550565", "0.97959393", "-0.6926547", "-0.82929504", "-0.84669334", "-0.026435554", "1.1836303", "-2.6556628", "-0.9201901", "0.50128466", "-2.1676817", "-1.2825193", "-1.2327442", "1.8007811", "-0.60668385", "-0.29570457", "-2.3894138", "0.7349044", "-1.772662", "0.53469855", "0.11895197", "0.54381454", "-1.9184432", "0.79282224", "-0.4776297", "0.77508515", "-1.2394706", "0.29900694", "0.90876365", "0.30538914", "0.013672138", "0.8173919", "-0.6618893", "0.15799308", "0.17540906", "-1.02914", "0.43770376", "-0.31737742", "0.33427098", "0.7803882", "-1.2780316", "-1.6486665", "0.36323994", "-0.057202138", "0.23400848", "-1.8020473", "0.68400645", "0.40566936", "0.6249151", "-0.04343996", "0.19621618", "0.3833149", "-0.90025806", "-1.8349274", "0.6980214", "-0.42002153", "2.0579238", "-0.60805804", "-0.13553137", "0.043797016", "0.307267", "-1.1307572", "0.6069715", "-1.3956966", "-0.13358633", "0.7099161", "-1.0637468", "0.95135856", "-0.9550941", "-0.97443104", "-0.49232864", "-0.925348", "1.0460249", "0.49196795", "-0.08565342", "-0.039721172", "-1.2412332", "0.9424239", "-0.2643675", "-0.19202024", "-0.63114154", "-0.8888576", "-0.19406292", "-0.2642346", "-0.43202406", "0.39159045", "0.37417907", "1.2175192", "0.44548187", "0.25246927", "-0.015801504", "-0.66650814", "-0.49849132", "1.1045315", "0.52557456", "-1.9588093", "-0.44729307", "-0.50962687", "0.88755316"]}
