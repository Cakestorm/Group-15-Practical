Skeletal survey remains the mainstay of detection for injuries, but recent work has also elucidated a role for other modalities in fracture detection. Management should include proper orthopedic interventions, along with mandatory reporting of possible maltreatment to the local child protective services or other equivalent agency.\n"}]}, "text": "Musculoskeletal manifestations of child maltreatment represent common presentations to the emergency department.
