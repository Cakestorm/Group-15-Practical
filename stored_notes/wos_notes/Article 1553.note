Common presenting findings include complex skull fractures, rib fractures, long bone fractures, and metaphyseal corner fractures. Skeletal survey remains the mainstay of detection for injuries, but recent work has also elucidated a role for other modalities in fracture detection. Management should include proper orthopedic interventions, along with mandatory reporting of possible maltreatment to the local child protective services or other equivalent agency.\n"}]}, "text": "Musculoskeletal manifestations of child maltreatment represent common presentations to the emergency department.
