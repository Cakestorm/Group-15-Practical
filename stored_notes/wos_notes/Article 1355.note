{"title": "Article 1355", "body": "The design, construction, and experimental evaluation of a cascade thermoacoustic engine are presented in this paper. The system was designed and built under the constraint of an inexpensive device to meet the energy needs of the people based in remote and rural areas. From the cost and straightforward system point of view, the air at atmospheric pressure was applied as a working fluid, and the main resonator tubes were then constructed of conventional polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipes. Such device consists of one standing-wave unit and one traveling-wave unit connected in series. This topology is preferred because the traveling-wave unit provides an efficient energy conversion, and a straight-line series configuration is easy to build and allows no Gedeon streaming. The system was designed to operate at a low frequency of about 57 Hz. The measured results were in a reasonably good agreement with the predicted results. So far, this system can deliver up to 61W of acoustic power, which was about 17% of the Carnot efficiency. In the further step, the proposed device will be applied as the prime mover for driving the thermoacoustic refrigerator.\n", "text": "The design, construction, and experimental evaluation of a cascade thermoacoustic engine are presented in this paper.
