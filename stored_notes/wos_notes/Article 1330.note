{"body": "Carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play a pivotal role in promoting the growth, invasion and metastasis of tumor cells. However, to date little is known about the oncogenic mechanisms of CAFs. This study aimed to identify the microenvironmental factors involved in tumor development and progression directed by CAFs in liver metastases. Tissue samples collected from 20 patients with colorectal liver metastases were used in this study. Histological and morphological characterization of the samples was performed using hybridization and immunohistological assays. The m RNA expression of a-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) was measured by northern blotting. The expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). As a result, co-expression of Thy-1 (CD90) and alpha-SMA was identified in CAFs, while normal liver samples were negative for alpha-SMA and Thy-1. Compared with epidermal growth factor (EGF) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) incubation, the expression of alpha-SMA increased significantly following transforming growth factor-1 (TGF-1) incubation (P<0.05), while platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) caused a significant suppression of alpha-SMA expression (P<0.05). PAI-1 expression was significantly lower in unstimulated fibroblasts compared to TGF-1-treated fibroblasts (P<0.01). The levels of PAI-1 transcription were significantly higher in CAFs from the patient samples compared with the healthy controls. Taken together, our findings suggest that CAFs may be important in migration, matrix degradation, invasion and angiogenesis of tumors, and TGF-1 may promote the activation of PAI-1 transcription in CAFs.\n", "embeddings": ["0.15098266", "0.5160771", "-0.52075696", "-1.7942907", "0.5714455", "-1.9383955", "0.046351247", "1.8063245", "-1.1917546", "-0.170904", "-0.49457076", "-0.108622134", "-0.5524969", "1.1046206", "-0.35931057", "0.65172416", "-0.70375377", "0.16830489", "0.36749926", "-2.7907898", "1.254859", "0.8848774", "0.37439138", "0.33878678", "-1.3933877", "-0.79197437", "0.17499964", "1.1461376", "-0.45711896", "0.63996154", "1.5625556", "-0.3063147", "1.4758241", "-0.721598", "0.79217064", "0.5122996", "0.0439859", "-1.4969358", "0.3801376", "-0.4783682", "-0.8015261", "-0.55033314", "-1.2336277", "-1.9134617", "0.24689782", "0.8032662", "0.29304206", "0.051157653", "0.6750098", "0.80821055", "-0.3349581", "-0.049324356", "-1.1251537", "0.33080217", "0.65726554", "0.10826843", "-1.8750865", "-2.1040413", "-0.40414733", "0.20974945", "0.3440173", "-0.35910904", "0.2461691", "0.5804827", "0.10914874", "0.8916145", "1.0871246", "0.08401167", "-0.78650767", "0.7297052", "-0.8145542", "-0.13477315", "0.44007558", "0.87936836", "-0.3451464", "0.5666522", "1.722664", "-1.2678314", "-1.5362476", "-0.074661605", "-0.55749506", "-1.1394054", "-0.36871246", "0.5117604", "-0.2313904", "-0.65226513", "-0.25039548", "0.536126", "0.42597392", "-0.5673289", "0.9318736", "0.7220214", "-0.7973533", "0.30480635", "-0.10010535", "-1.2307775", "-0.1604964", "-1.534758", "1.0770245", "0.65298474", "0.15219764", "-0.272795", "0.54274684", "0.12573776", "-1.0376592", "-0.2684436", "-0.45784354", "1.7086918", "-0.729289", "0.38479847", "-0.42861006", "-1.2606632", "-0.47190464", "0.71038747", "1.8652508", "-0.7241861", "0.16555572", "-0.726541", "-0.6445794", "-1.4986411", "-0.26432836", "-0.6105289", "1.2303914", "-0.52071875", "1.0273533", "-0.18921351", "0.5082817", "0.7027597", "-0.14011103", "0.8017342", "2.2858236", "-0.18467416", "-1.2979345", "-0.27473077", "-0.036408994", "1.0604781", "-0.3775082", "-1.2331074", "0.028468205", "-1.2019624", "-1.0703679", "-0.07549585", "-0.39849085", "-1.245308", "-0.38957238", "-0.06385335", "0.16022758", "-0.4246655", "-0.15364425", "1.9138337", "0.7783298", "0.3010635", "-0.7395108", "1.1146125", "-1.398705", "0.27764264", "0.87652797", "0.4413664", "0.67503214", "0.59553146", "0.19936709", "0.106585905", "0.4436268", "-0.40396357", "-1.0932908", "-0.28147736", "0.5135908", "0.093356", "-1.3331044", "0.06935899", "-1.8550613", "0.30822867", "-0.16584247", "0.96951485", "0.55652136", "-0.8271409", "1.1369876", "-1.3431113", "1.3622675", "0.78797185", "-0.7136824", "-0.5567524", "0.6062336", "0.2245527", "-0.09645311", "0.60119283", "-1.2340788", "0.35048962", "0.9332572", "-0.18121971", "1.1762977", "-0.043161962", "0.92703015", "-0.38626286", "0.4613523", "-0.085575126", "0.44463882", "-1.6702431", "0.39345324", "-0.9209935"]}
