{"title": "Article 1232", "body": "The characterization and quantitative analyses of the key transcription factors for spermiogenesis are necessary in the identification of causal factors for the production of the seemingly normal sperm with dysfunctions in Japanese Black bulls and further elucidation of whole aspect of molecular mechanisms for spermiogenesis in livestock. The objective of this study was to obtain the information regarding the characterization and individual changes of an activator cAMP-responsive element modulator (CREM), which is necessary to the normal progress of spermiogenesis and is required for the transcriptional activity of genes coding essential factors for the sperm fertilization ability in rodents, using testes from 21 Japanese Black bulls with the ability to produce sperm indicating the normal motility and morphology. The bull CREM Tay (one of activator variants) was detected in testes more strongly than livers by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Northern blotting. This variant was localized in the nuclei of spermatids as shown by indirect immunofluorescence with the homemade mouse antiserum. The motility and morphology of the cauda epididymal sperm from 16 Japanese Black bulls were examined before the quantitative analyses of testicular activator CREM to confirm the ability to produce sperm with normal motility and morphology in these males. The percentages of the motile sperm, those of the sperm with the normal acrosomes, and those of morphologically normal sperm were 60.0% to 90.0%, 88.0% to 100%, and 83.0% to 97.9%, respectively. The quantitative analyses with real-time polymerase chain reaction using the testicular RNA from the same bulls revealed that the relative expression levels of activator CREM variants in testes varied significantly among these bulls in the range from 0.56 to 1.64 (P < 0.05). These results are consistent with the suggestions that CREM Tay are involved in the spermiogenesis in the testes of Japanese Black bulls and that the expression levels of the activator CREM variant mRNAs in the testes are varied significantly among individual bulls that have the ability to produce sperm with the normal motility and morphology.
