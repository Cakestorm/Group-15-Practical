ConclusionAlthough some crack users had higher (>75th percentile) bacterial counts for Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Fusobacterium nucleatum, total counts did not differ between crack users and non-users, leading to the hypothesis that the higher occurrence of periodontitis on crack users may be related to other non-bacterial factors.\n"}]}, "text": "ObjectiveTo compare counts of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum between crack users and non-users.
