{"title": "Article 1799", "body": "ObjectiveTo compare counts of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum between crack users and non-users. Materials and methodsA cross-sectional study was conducted involving seventy-four crack cocaine users and eighty-one non-users matched for age, gender and tobacco use. Demographic and clinical variables were analysed. Subgingival bacterial samples were collected from four sites with the greatest probing depths and were analysed using real-time polymerase chain reaction. ResultsNo significant difference was found in the prevalence of total counts for each bacterial species analysed between groups. However, crack users had a 1.85 (95% CI: 1.03-3.31), 2.19 (95% CI 1.24-3.88), 2.53 (95% CI 1.27-5.04) and 2.40 (95% CI 1.22-4.75) greater probability of having the higher counts (75th percentile) for Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Fusobacterium nucleatum, respectively. ConclusionAlthough some crack users had higher (>75th percentile) bacterial counts for Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Fusobacterium nucleatum, total counts did not differ between crack users and non-users, leading to the hypothesis that the higher occurrence of periodontitis on crack users may be related to other non-bacterial factors.\n", "text": "ObjectiveTo compare counts of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum between crack users and non-users.
