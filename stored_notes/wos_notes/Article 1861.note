This phenomenon can be more effective when combined with accessibility factors and street connectivity. The case of Bojnourd has been selected for this study. The most important reason to choose this case is that the municipality gives commercial construction permits to developers in this city without paying attention to traffic consequences. Bojnourd is a medium-sized city and the capital of the North Khorasan province. The ultimate goal of this study is to determine the effectiveness of both commercial land use and route configuration on number of trips. For this purpose, analysis of secondary data has been used as the method of study. Findings showed that there is a significant relationship between commercial land use and trip volume in Bojnourd city. Findings also indicated a strong correlation between the syntax of routes and traffic flow in the case of Bojnourd. The combined effect of both commercial land use and route configuration on the number of trips was examined and both factors that influence the number of trips were significant.
