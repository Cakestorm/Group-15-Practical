{"body": "Background: Child abuse is often unrecognized at out-of-hours primary care (OOH-PC) services. The aim of our study was to evaluate the clinical outcome of the screening instrument SPUTOVAMO-R2 for child abuse (checklist), followed by a structured approach (reporting code), at OOH-PC services. The reporting code with five steps should ensure consistent action in case of a suspicion. Methods: All children attending one of the five participating OOH-PC services in the region of Utrecht, the Netherlands, in a year time, were included. The checklist is an obligatory field in the electronic patient file and was filled in for all children. In case of a positive checklist, the steps in the reporting code were followed. Additionally, the case was evaluated in a multidisciplinary team to determine the probability of child abuse. Results: The checklist was filled in for 50671 children; 108 (0.2 %) were positive. The multidisciplinary team diagnosed child abuse in 24 (22 %) of the 108 positive checklists, and no child abuse in 36 (33 %). Emotional neglect was the most frequent type of abuse diagnosed. For all abused children, care was implemented according to the protocol. The most frequent care given was a referral to the hospital (N = 7) or contact with child's own general practitioner (N = 6). Conclusion: A checklist followed by a reporting code guarantees consistent actions and care for children with a suspicion of child abuse. The percentage of positive checklists is lower than expected. Validity of the checklist should be assessed in a diagnostic study.\n", "embeddings": ["0.9192047", "-1.4548451", "0.5074387", "-1.1369376", "0.5332902", "1.8893155", "0.50887465", "-0.24829379", "0.30462673", "-0.65933746", "-0.27913427", "-0.36535108", "0.4765436", "-1.0291975", "-1.0354244", "0.6021052", "-0.54217935", "0.23388143", "1.6816484", "-1.1131396", "0.39624077", "0.07183666", "-0.32872424", "0.02004449", "1.0574621", "0.8579552", "0.41729265", "0.37518442", "0.8723546", "-0.8790017", "2.4772112", "1.783306", "1.1282192", "1.4193745", "-1.0016148", "-1.5258276", "0.04838209", "-0.5151208", "-0.110706314", "-0.7321993", "1.7486827", "0.060917173", "0.36918503", "-1.2486874", "-0.2105012", "-0.6837869", "0.06744759", "0.48946828", "-1.2790239", "0.90644747", "1.4981556", "-0.4472681", "-0.5040151", "0.44012326", "-0.028663723", "0.9056844", "0.23386174", "0.82567006", "0.73631614", "1.0037378", "1.5774368", "1.1665893", "0.36415234", "0.25740376", "-1.5343041", "0.80310804", "0.11831823", "2.250787", "-0.061295085", "1.052952", "0.65459466", "-0.7038307", "0.22461648", "1.8117099", "0.6859696", "0.7035581", "0.87929785", "0.028510522", "-0.11956872", "0.49256143", "0.6657688", "-0.25707716", "-0.6004034", "0.30827948", "-0.34427294", "0.83037835", "-0.8999912", "-0.20037103", "-0.69557536", "0.16455999", "1.9489194", "-1.2507466", "0.99233", "0.40248853", "1.083529", "0.67952573", "-0.8839146", "2.0091155", "-0.72575325", "-0.8173863", "1.7188418", "1.8513374", "-0.80781585", "-0.17575842", "0.14506333", "-2.8442893", "-0.71531004", "2.6006591", "-0.6269612", "0.15712692", "-0.5739864", "-2.7343588", "0.1713258", "1.309519", "1.2374206", "-0.61184525", "1.9543107", "0.1944108", "0.35301733", "-1.3929255", "0.19960125", "0.0022826714", "0.039018877", "0.4611516", "-0.6229447", "0.6810191", "-2.4530017", "0.84346044", "1.0916575", "1.3466806", "1.0864104", "-1.3392987", "-0.26633254", "-1.4132459", "0.24722427", "0.97044146", "0.10392426", "1.0608072", "-1.3103858", "-1.4105664", "-0.57114017", "0.45747912", "1.0477426", "-0.43552908", "-0.9512028", "-0.8415135", "0.02624878", "-0.34832555", "0.62161094", "0.7739341", "-0.6168934", "-1.0952084", "-1.0044316", "-0.010065094", "-0.043514904", "1.5061997", "0.19408087", "-1.0517253", "0.44233555", "-0.69786495", "-0.30730414", "0.3501101", "0.331845", "0.5437614", "0.32492864", "0.5149381", "0.699437", "-1.2467594", "-1.6306909", "1.1662998", "-1.6569234", "0.13402626", "0.6395795", "0.96106905", "0.9855893", "-0.40836653", "0.31930673", "0.50950855", "1.3377911", "-0.17257018", "0.19427308", "2.5044014", "0.6558542", "1.1450632", "0.9332314", "0.6300987", "-1.2931396", "-0.4119082", "1.1979985", "0.41876087", "1.4788457", "-0.7534924", "-0.33823818", "-0.44941717", "-0.38088182", "0.08465801", "0.48525813", "-0.041485827", "-1.0099378", "-0.19413175"]}
