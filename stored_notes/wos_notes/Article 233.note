{"body": "Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) have been linked to increased use of tobacco products later in life. However, studies to date have ignored smokeless tobacco products. To address this, data from the 2011 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, which interviewed adults 18 years and over (N = 102,716) were analyzed. Logistic regression models were fit to estimate odds ratios of ever smoking, current smoking and current smokeless tobacco use in relation to ACEs. Results showed that less than 4 % of respondents currently used smokeless tobacco products, while 44.95 and 18.57 % reported ever and current smoking, respectively. Physical abuse (OR 1.40; 95 % CI 1.14, 1.72), emotional abuse (OR 1.41; 95 % CI 1.19, 1.67), sexual abuse (OR 0.70; 95 % CI 0.51, 0.95), living with a drug user (OR 1.50; 95 % CI 1.17, 1.93), living with someone who was jailed (OR 1.50; 95 % CI 1.11, 2.02) and having parents who were separated or divorced (OR 1.31; 95 % CI 1.09, 1.57) were associated with smokeless tobacco use in unadjusted models. After accounting for confounders, physical abuse (OR 1.43; 95 % CI 1.16, 1.78), emotional abuse (OR 1.32; 95 % CI 1.10, 1.57), living with a problem drinker (OR 1.30; 95 % CI 1.08, 1.58), living with a drug user (OR 1.31; 95 % CI 1.00, 1.72) and living with adults who treated each other violently (OR 1.30; 95 % CI 1.05, 1.62) were associated with smokeless tobacco use. Living with someone who was mentally ill (OR 0.70; 95 % CI 0.53, 0.92) was associated with smokeless tobacco use after accounting for confounders and all ACEs. Results indicated that some childhood adversities are associated with use of smokeless tobacco products. Special attention is needed to prevent tobacco use of different types among those experiencing ACEs.\n", "embeddings": ["0.27485982", "-1.5298718", "1.222132", "0.6895101", "0.13029021", "0.20819212", "-0.3183431", "2.4692833", "-0.8779076", "2.1445844", "-0.71362245", "-1.587845", "-0.8209962", "0.051468648", "-1.1455498", "-0.14778279", "0.11397533", "-0.747155", "-0.5147362", "-1.7263796", "-0.7969637", "-0.25769022", "-0.289257", "0.17492254", "-0.46566015", "0.110615626", "-0.7090812", "0.59296703", "0.15155731", "-0.48579755", "0.7788461", "2.1387265", "0.47515845", "-0.94976777", "-0.05255237", "0.59916615", "0.5295472", "-0.13573383", "0.07539293", "-0.04941152", "-1.4720252", "-0.42938334", "0.18399824", "-1.6947592", "-1.563782", "-0.1424662", "-0.97522825", "0.42655465", "-0.47846124", "-0.4153146", "1.3781784", "-1.7611448", "0.62315214", "0.617068", "0.5412992", "-0.91924447", "-0.33126408", "-0.25842077", "0.4576947", "0.737634", "0.19404443", "-0.19084896", "0.4045405", "-0.5093098", "0.22790286", "0.03818181", "0.52092606", "1.3986729", "-0.5004151", "0.8567834", "-0.78282535", "-0.6692947", "-1.6724842", "-0.0010199585", "-0.601255", "-0.20442083", "-0.10177558", "0.6544262", "-0.9511238", "0.04976363", "-0.2727023", "0.47879916", "0.27082503", "2.2690296", "-1.3887475", "1.6587052", "-0.08165463", "0.84798884", "-0.57689697", "0.4813759", "1.1478074", "2.7726882", "2.0897229", "0.15607665", "0.58523107", "-0.23522915", "-0.7533025", "-0.2359065", "0.7751065", "1.0068731", "1.1192185", "0.8169953", "0.92058307", "-1.2025633", "-0.11858011", "-0.95369476", "1.6559885", "1.8849443", "-0.41839164", "-1.2765856", "-0.87104833", "-0.51583403", "-0.84706193", "0.19719416", "0.7525944", "-0.26160923", "-0.67254245", "0.3032874", "-0.13910381", "-1.9545932", "0.25365016", "0.11423555", "-0.07231404", "0.14598598", "1.0691421", "-0.70538515", "1.963512", "0.088754594", "0.25875533", "0.07744847", "0.42663088", "-0.49652717", "0.4913916", "-0.062768035", "-0.16921596", "-0.060005527", "-0.4762617", "-0.24507374", "0.5381311", "-2.290557", "-0.97788584", "0.29448563", "-0.32462052", "-0.8086308", "-0.12331654", "-0.38855404", "-0.3043079", "-0.0038095347", "0.10884014", "1.1573213", "-1.3131067", "0.6652298", "1.4091936", "1.09547", "-1.5576543", "1.1761447", "-0.53076315", "-0.36589342", "0.16665395", "-0.24825817", "0.9616687", "0.33668256", "-1.2310467", "-0.27475974", "0.6185036", "0.94773436", "0.5457676", "-1.3004119", "-1.2584223", "-0.028732207", "0.67920333", "0.7154137", "1.1984391", "0.32284835", "1.3536111", "0.73346126", "-0.20627622", "1.2232378", "1.5904517", "0.60639846", "0.78191954", "1.2043947", "-0.170416", "0.6343724", "0.17488955", "0.17115495", "-0.30652344", "0.11633422", "-0.9712386", "0.17265175", "0.09167588", "0.027748292", "-0.06079919", "-0.34342846", "-0.3554658", "-0.17597064", "0.0071621696", "0.12005142", "-0.61659896", "0.36633608"]}
