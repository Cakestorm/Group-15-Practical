The article focuses on the results of interviews and focus groups conducted as part of the evaluation of this initiative. Twelve jurisdictions were purposively selected to exhibit a range of family court and non-family court jurisdictions in rural and middle-sized locations. The discussion of the qualitative results focuses on changes in court practice and the impact of the initiative on case time. Key Points for the Family Court Community: This initiative was undertaken to promote consistency of practice in family law matters. We explain how the rules impact the following areas: divorce; property distribution as a result of divorce; custody, visitation, and child support; adoption; termination of parental rights; domestic violence, child abuse, and neglect; and status offenses. We describe the impact of a state-wide court improvement initiative. We identify areas of improvement within court operations that may be modified in other jurisdictions.\n"}]}, "text": "This article describes a court improvement initiative designed to promote uniformity and improved court practice with the ultimate goal of the improvement of outcomes for children and families.
