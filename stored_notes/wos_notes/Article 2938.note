This study examines the genetic classification in Australian blood donors with a weak D phenotype and correlates RHD variants associated with the weak D phenotype against D-epitope profile. Materials and MethodsFollowing automated and manual serology, blood samples from donors reported as weak D' (n = 100) were RHD genotyped by a commercial SNP-typing platform and Sanger sequencing. Two commercial anti-D antibody kits were used for extended serological testing for D-epitope profiles. ResultsThree samples had wild-type RHD exonic sequences, and 97 samples had RHD variants. RHD*weak D type 1, RHD*weak D type 2 or RHD*weak D type 3 was detected in 75 donors. The remaining 22 samples exhibited 17 different RHD variants. One donor exhibited a novel RHD*c.939+3A>C lacking one D-epitope. Weak D types 11, 5, 15, 17 and 90 showed a partial D-epitope profile. ConclusionThe array of RHD variants detected in this study indicated diversity in the Australian donor population that needs to be accommodated for in future genotyping strategies.\n"}]}, "text": "Background and ObjectivesVariant RHD genes associated with the weak D phenotype can result in complete or partial D-epitope expression on the red cell.
