{"title": "Article 2602", "body": "Electrochemical immunosensors have the potential to transform analytical procedures within the food industry by providing highly specific, rapid, and inexpensive determination of pathogens. In this paper, recent advances in this area are outlined. In particular, attention is paid to new methods that have been developed for the modification of working electrode surfaces. Many advances have been related to the use of novel nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes, graphene, and metallic nanoparticles, often used in conjunction with each other or polymers. The use of these materials has generally provided superior sensor sensitivity. The application of immunosensors to the detection of a range of pathogens in real samples is then investigated to establish whether they provide solutions in practical applications.\n", "text": "Electrochemical immunosensors have the potential to transform analytical procedures within the food industry by providing highly specific, rapid, and inexpensive determination of pathogens.
