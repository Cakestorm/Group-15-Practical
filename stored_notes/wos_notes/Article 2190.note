{"body": "Background: The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of the iron chelator deferiprone in diabetic nephropathy (DN) rats and the mechanisms involved. Methods: Thirty-two male Wistar rats (180-220 g, 6 weeks old) were randomly divided into a control group, a DN group and two DN groups treated with either 50 or 100 mg/kg per day deferiprone. The DN group was established by feeding of a high-carbohydrate-fat diet and injection of 35 mg/kg streptozotocin into the vena caudalis. The duration of deferiprone treatment was 20 weeks. Histopathological changes were detected by hematoxylin-eosin and Masson staining, as well as transmission electron microscopy. Levels of nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B, monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, tissue-specific inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1, cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-2, and nitrotyrosine were determined in kidney tissues using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. Results: Histopathological observations showed that deferiprone treatment alleviated inflammation infiltrates and collagenous fibrosis in DN rats. Results from RT-PCR and western blotting indicated that deferiprone inhibited the expression of NF-kappa B, MCP-1, COX-2, and nitrotyrosine, which were overexpressed in DN rats. Immunohistochemistry showed that the mechanism of deferiprone action may involve regulation of MMP-9 and TIMP-1. Decreased MMP-9 expression and increased TIMP-1 expression in DN rats were significantly promoted and inhibited by deferiprone, respectively. Conclusion: Iron chelation by oral deferiprone has a renoprotective effect in DN rats by relieving oxidative stress, inflammation, and fibrosis, which is related to the cytokines NF-kappa B, MCP-1, MMP-9, TIMP-1, COX-2, and nitrotyrosine.\n", "embeddings": ["0.6615049", "-1.2750418", "-1.3052393", "0.12560609", "1.1720945", "-0.60387367", "0.101844184", "1.7771566", "-1.9473305", "0.44580904", "-0.69857544", "0.24406323", "-1.2180555", "1.6675546", "-1.1796392", "-1.6323572", "-0.6049155", "0.5272958", "-0.26873615", "-2.422718", "-0.603274", "0.39364272", "-0.4673192", "1.544234", "0.2202121", "-1.0556778", "0.023653802", "-0.6589558", "-2.4147127", "-0.44951335", "1.4401381", "1.5019611", "1.2567484", "-0.85568786", "-1.0608256", "0.09270853", "0.31195948", "-0.27104327", "1.7871946", "0.22491753", "-1.1413834", "-0.47747368", "-0.69786805", "0.44693106", "-0.6736481", "0.29046664", "0.77703464", "0.04839176", "0.26920322", "-1.6698333", "1.9751785", "-1.0087206", "0.404672", "-1.3164992", "0.56128526", "-0.1061569", "-1.2812911", "-0.47253948", "-0.33880946", "0.9612363", "0.56682", "0.8793841", "1.2377443", "-0.3553335", "-0.7253458", "1.2666891", "0.9204293", "0.5163302", "0.33210576", "0.31987646", "0.18880405", "0.75838304", "0.43683356", "0.5946579", "1.1051174", "0.50902855", "0.8912935", "-0.059893414", "-0.63356763", "0.5762883", "-0.30207276", "0.6382112", "-0.5583109", "1.6158087", "-0.4377575", "-0.04206683", "0.79755825", "0.6826854", "-0.45216587", "0.76251626", "0.72330856", "-0.13048673", "-0.8703151", "2.0866868", "0.8012978", "0.23803987", "-0.62078583", "-1.1565212", "-0.8652377", "-0.25574204", "1.1353046", "0.16075017", "1.8948631", "-0.18976054", "-1.8011096", "-0.13871153", "0.6850553", "1.1041845", "0.36994198", "-0.60364795", "-0.08939977", "-1.8299679", "-1.0336331", "0.35001037", "-0.5949027", "-1.2882608", "0.8141359", "-0.77798223", "-0.75152755", "-0.7748343", "-0.874048", "0.6247533", "0.267962", "-0.36251783", "1.4355894", "0.7301912", "-0.26053938", "-2.2091196", "-1.3166672", "-0.1634091", "0.13483694", "-0.6384165", "-0.66431206", "-0.0752342", "0.29613444", "0.9817506", "-0.24461241", "-0.06799938", "-1.2264873", "-0.5858682", "0.6416696", "0.38938117", "0.110456474", "-0.26086825", "-0.12828101", "0.8561018", "0.91355664", "-1.2196969", "0.4203827", "1.8689693", "0.19087632", "-1.1074822", "-1.7334971", "0.459848", "-1.5809758", "0.33264226", "0.6126274", "0.66526794", "0.1196336", "-0.44434422", "-0.10354767", "0.8102863", "0.5813317", "1.2008146", "0.0831011", "0.2413127", "0.5001491", "0.34378114", "-0.31721658", "-0.3068126", "-1.5147897", "-0.15253313", "-0.05446149", "0.38120782", "1.0114267", "-0.72038144", "1.5617344", "-0.26463735", "0.21888605", "0.7211158", "-1.1885722", "-0.6476182", "1.9132813", "-1.0582088", "-0.1356242", "-0.37959546", "-0.49460003", "1.439404", "0.042461097", "0.18275186", "1.3160554", "0.33085877", "-1.2917186", "-0.98660296", "0.5702479", "-0.45969096", "-0.013381846", "0.2809091", "-0.30178753", "-0.8558337"]}
