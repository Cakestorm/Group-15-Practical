{"title": "Article 832", "body": {"ops": [{"insert": "To explore the influence of the direct repeat sequence (DRS) in Bacillus chitinase genes on heterogonous expression in Escherichia coli, we cloned and sequenced the entire open reading frame (ORF) and upstream sequences of the chitinase B (chiB) and chitinase MY75 (chiMY75) from Bacillus thuringiensis and Bacillus licheniformis. A pair of 8-bp DRS was found upstream of each chi gene. Chi ORFs with a series of truncated DRS were cloned and transformed into E. coli XL-Blue. The activity of the transformants without the DRS were significantly higher in chitinase assays than transformants containing the DRS. SOS-PAGE showed that part and full deletion of the DRS increased chi gene expression by approximately 1.7 and 3.8-fold, respectively. Northern blotting revealed deletion of the DRS regions increased chiB and chiMY75 mRNA expression. Specific binding of DNA-binding factors in the E. coli cell lyaste was observed to both the chiB and chiMY75 promoter regions and DRS elements. This is the first investigation to demonstrate that heterologous expression of Bacillus chi genes in E. coli is negatively regulated by their upstream DRS regions, which act as cis-acting elements.
