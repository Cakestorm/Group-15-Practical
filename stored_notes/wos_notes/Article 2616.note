The HLA-G is expressed in distinct mRNA isoforms, one of which encodes a soluble HLA-G (sHLA-G) protein, detectable by sandwich ELISA. Therefore, sHLA-G ELISAs have been used as a noninvasive diagnosis system.

Using this system, we determined sHLA-G protein in amniotic fluids, and found that sHLA-G levels at preterm (similar to 36 weeks) were clearly higher than those at term (37-41weeks).
