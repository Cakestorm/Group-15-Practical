{"title": "Article 2428", "body": {"ops": [{"insert": "The present study was aimed to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of NBP in the mice models of TBI, as well as the possible role of Nrf2-ARE pathways in the assumptive neuroprotection. In mice,a modified Marmarou's weight-drop model was employed to induce TBI. ICR mice were randomly assigned to four experimental groups: sham, TBI, TBI+vehicle(V) and TBI+NBP. NBP (100 mg/kg) was administered via an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection at 1 h following TBI. The administration of NBP significantly ameliorated the effects of the brain injury, including neurological deficits, brain water content, and cortical neuronal apoptosis. Furthermore, the level of malondialdehyde and the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) paired with glutathione peroxidase (GPx) were restored in the NBP treatment group. NBP promoted the translocation of Nrf2 protein from the cytoplasm to the nucleus markedly, increased the expressions of Nrf2-ARE pathway-related downstream factors, including hemeoxygenase-1(HO-1) and NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), and prevented the decline of antioxidant enzyme activities, including SOD and GPx. NBP enhanced the translocation of Nrf2 to the nucleus from the cytoplasm,verified by a western blot, immunofluorescence. Additionally, it upregulated the expression of the Nrf2 downstream factors such as HO-1 and NQO1 were also confirmed via a western blot and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. In conclusion, NBP administration may increase the activities of antioxidant enzymes and attenuate brain injury in a TBI model, potentially via the mediation of the Nrf2-ARE pathway.\n"}]}, "text": "The present study was aimed to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of NBP in the mice models of TBI, as well as the possible role of Nrf2-ARE pathways in the assumptive neuroprotection.
