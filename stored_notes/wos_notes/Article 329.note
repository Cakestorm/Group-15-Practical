{"title": "Article 329", "body": "Introduction: Some glial-neuronal tumors (GNT) (pleomorphic xantho-astrocytoma [PXA], ganglioglioma [GG]) display BRAF-V600E mutation, which represents a diagnostic clue to these entities. Targeted therapies against BRAF-V600 protein have shown promising results in GNT. The aim of this study was to assess the utility of BRAF-V600E immunohistochemistry (IHC, clone VE1) in daily practice in a series of 140 glial, and GNT compared to molecular biology (MB) techniques. Methods: We performed BRAF-V600E IHC on all 140 cases. We used Sanger sequencing and allele-specific quantitative PCR (ASQ-PCR) to detect BRAF-V600E mutation when sufficient amount of materiel was available. Results: BRAF-V600E immunostaining was detected in 29.5% of cases (41/140 cases; 61.5% GG/GC/AGG (32/52), 33% PXA, 6.6% pilocytic astrocytomas). In 47 cases, MB could be performed: Sanger sequencing and ASQ-PCR in 34 cases, ASQ-PCR only in 11 cases, and Sanger sequencing only in two cases. In initial tumors, Sanger sequencing identified BRAF-V600E mutation in 19.5% tumors (seven of 36 tested cases). ASQ-PCR showed mutation in 48.5% tumors (17/35 tested cases). In six cases (5 GG, one PXA), the results were discordant between IHC and MB; the five GG cases were immunopositive for BRAF-V600E but wild type with both MB techniques. In another 7 GG, the percentage of mutated (ganglion) cells was low, and Sanger sequencing failed to detect the mutation, which was detected by IHC and ASQ-PCR. Conclusions: In tumors with few mutated cells (e.g., GG), anti-BRAF-V600E IHC appears more sensitive than Sanger sequencing. The latter, although considered as the gold standard, is not to be used up-front to detect BRAF mutation in GG. The combination of IHC and ASQ-PCR appears more efficient to appraise the indication of targeted therapies in these glioneuronal tumors.\n", "text": "Introduction: Some glial-neuronal tumors (GNT) (pleomorphic xantho-astrocytoma [PXA], ganglioglioma [GG]) display BRAF-V600E mutation, which represents a diagnostic clue to these entities.
