{"body": "Unaccustomed exercise is known to produce strength loss, soreness, and myocellular disruption. With repeated application of exercise stimuli, the appearance of these indexes of muscle damage is attenuated, the so-called \" repeated bout effect.\" No direct connection has been established between this repeated bout effect and exercise-induced increases in protein turnover, but it appears that a degree of tolerance is developed toward exercise for both. The present study sought to investigate markers of protein degradation by determining the expression of components related to the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) with repeated exercise bouts. Healthy men carried out 30 min of bench stepping, performing eccentric work with one and concentric work with the other leg (n = 14), performing a duplicate exercise bout 8 wk later. A nonexercising control group was included (n = 6). RNA was extracted from muscle biopsies representing time points preexercise, + 3 h, + 24 h, and + 7 days, and selected mRNA species were quantified using Northern blotting. The exercise model proved sufficient to produce a repeated bout effect in terms of strength and soreness. For forkhead box O transcription factor 1 (FOXO1) and muscle RING finger protein-1 (MURF1), strong upregulations were seen exclusively with concentric loading (P < 0.001), while atrogin-1 displayed a strong downregulation exclusively in response to eccentric exercise (P < 0.001). For MURF1 transcription, the first bout produced a downregulation that persisted until the second bout (P < 0.01). In conclusion, the UPS is modulated differentially in response to varying loading modalities and with different time frames in a way that to some extent reflects changes in protein metabolism known to take place with exercise.\n", "embeddings": ["1.2149879", "-0.88597006", "0.045339227", "0.42033756", "-0.3662411", "0.44682354", "0.0015851817", "1.6107038", "-0.6836231", "0.081557445", "-1.1849189", "0.70172983", "0.037786912", "1.2802813", "-2.6473715", "-0.83792585", "-0.92441696", "0.5858238", "0.12296925", "-2.106988", "-0.36645824", "1.1349798", "1.2897882", "-2.2850044", "1.238174", "0.52137995", "0.96072733", "-0.71601075", "-0.052759837", "-1.0405556", "1.2875315", "-0.12527342", "-1.338963", "0.27198467", "-0.7279977", "-0.23551202", "0.7817694", "-0.9517531", "1.5247002", "-0.7864332", "1.39903", "0.18847194", "0.42950892", "-1.6983478", "1.3904343", "-0.54247236", "0.31220248", "0.516823", "0.64286274", "-1.1980329", "1.3262609", "-1.2382864", "-0.24495555", "-1.3331231", "0.9612381", "0.5570713", "-0.5924849", "-1.9937979", "-0.48269612", "-0.98610294", "-0.19670287", "-1.9325116", "0.7345784", "0.4573838", "-0.8639097", "1.6663814", "0.9141193", "-0.3467058", "0.7464975", "0.8037355", "-1.4417632", "-0.9896729", "-0.62849325", "-0.5392064", "-0.49535498", "1.5964762", "-1.6628852", "-1.1613222", "1.2191678", "0.80224836", "0.7018318", "0.13947842", "-1.2834144", "1.539135", "0.71200264", "0.07079752", "-0.7542055", "0.60959804", "1.2476082", "0.3400658", "1.8995892", "-0.9517927", "-0.34154528", "0.24798511", "1.0151044", "0.01827518", "0.060515795", "1.6813444", "1.7092369", "2.2917728", "-0.9305695", "-0.14929536", "1.7109182", "0.77085656", "-0.9845739", "-0.3397865", "0.09082166", "0.34190452", "-1.0079602", "-0.9056363", "0.047967564", "-0.4111832", "-0.036597546", "-0.6406147", "-1.5734581", "-0.49103323", "1.3542517", "-0.15838122", "0.5669649", "-0.7824519", "-0.8972033", "0.4665145", "0.7280231", "0.33376935", "-0.08540844", "1.1285324", "-1.4676943", "-1.8500092", "-0.84008723", "0.8864975", "0.17452212", "-0.53032005", "-1.2503182", "-0.009566827", "0.39524847", "0.37597722", "-0.78790903", "1.2882857", "-1.9056134", "0.6931266", "1.7853324", "-0.27049053", "-0.5715899", "-1.0907195", "-0.7470701", "1.2730103", "0.16363928", "-0.5947806", "-0.6120894", "1.4666995", "-0.70183915", "-0.31443474", "-2.5347931", "-0.92481196", "-1.486396", "0.7172791", "0.19759725", "0.5809251", "0.045667835", "1.8854039", "1.6733549", "-0.054111782", "-0.19425946", "0.68664116", "2.870451", "-0.110001646", "0.37139964", "1.5583725", "-0.61657965", "-0.51656663", "1.4325328", "1.1027216", "0.17308864", "-1.5266427", "-0.4106887", "-0.51074624", "-0.8556566", "0.05003393", "-0.34105375", "0.40277693", "-0.9305791", "-1.8037939", "0.076367624", "-1.4912409", "0.05542444", "0.83918303", "-0.47978967", "1.9341125", "2.6009228", "-0.4932136", "1.1101807", "0.67964643", "0.22337191", "-1.9226595", "0.7526842", "0.39074263", "0.67106825", "0.36439714", "2.6740851", "-0.3638218"]}
