{"title": "Article 2529", "body": "Unaccustomed exercise is known to produce strength loss, soreness, and myocellular disruption. With repeated application of exercise stimuli, the appearance of these indexes of muscle damage is attenuated, the so-called \" repeated bout effect.\" No direct connection has been established between this repeated bout effect and exercise-induced increases in protein turnover, but it appears that a degree of tolerance is developed toward exercise for both. The present study sought to investigate markers of protein degradation by determining the expression of components related to the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) with repeated exercise bouts. Healthy men carried out 30 min of bench stepping, performing eccentric work with one and concentric work with the other leg (n = 14), performing a duplicate exercise bout 8 wk later. A nonexercising control group was included (n = 6). RNA was extracted from muscle biopsies representing time points preexercise, + 3 h, + 24 h, and + 7 days, and selected mRNA species were quantified using Northern blotting. The exercise model proved sufficient to produce a repeated bout effect in terms of strength and soreness. For forkhead box O transcription factor 1 (FOXO1) and muscle RING finger protein-1 (MURF1), strong upregulations were seen exclusively with concentric loading (P < 0.001), while atrogin-1 displayed a strong downregulation exclusively in response to eccentric exercise (P < 0.001). For MURF1 transcription, the first bout produced a downregulation that persisted until the second bout (P < 0.01). In conclusion, the UPS is modulated differentially in response to varying loading modalities and with different time frames in a way that to some extent reflects changes in protein metabolism known to take place with exercise.\n", "text": "Unaccustomed exercise is known to produce strength loss, soreness, and myocellular disruption.
