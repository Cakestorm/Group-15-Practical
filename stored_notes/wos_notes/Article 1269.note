{"title": "Article 1269", "body": {"ops": [{"insert": "Molecular imaging agents have the ability to non-invasively visualize, characterize, and quantify the molecular biology of disease. Recent advances in nuclear probe development, particularly in PET radiotracers, have generated many new imaging agents with precise molecular targets. With such specificity, PET probes may be utilized as biomarkers to objectively interrogate and evaluate pathology. Whereas the current indications for PET imaging are predominately confined to staging and restaging of malignancy, the utility of PET greatly expands when utilized as a biomarker, the topic of this review. As an imaging biomarker, PET may be used to (1) measure target expression to select subsets of patients who would most benefit from targeted therapy; (2) measure early treatment response to predict therapeutic efficacy; and (3) relate tumor response to survival. This review will discuss the application of radiotracers to targeted cancer therapy. Particular attention is given to new radiotracers evaluated in recently completed clinical trials and those with current or potential clinical utility. The diverse roles of PET in clinical trails for drug development are also examined. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
