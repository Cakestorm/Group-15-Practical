{"title": "Article 516", "body": {"ops": [{"insert": "OBJECTIVE: We investigated the expression of annexin A5 (ANXA5) in human cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) cell line and its effect on proliferation, migration, and apoptosis of human CCA cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Expression of ANXA5 was detected by fluorescent quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blotting method in 2 human CCA cell lines, QBC939 and RBE. 3 shRNA plasmids for ANXA5 silencing (ANXA5-sh1, ANXA5-sh2, ANXA5-sh3) and 1 negative control plasmid were constructed to infect QBC939 cells. The infection efficiency, expression of ANXA5, apoptosis and cell cycle of QBC939 cell were measured separately. RESULTS: The expression of ANXA5 in QBC939 cell was significantly higher than RBE cell. Expressed ANXA5 protein in the QBC939-KD cell (QBC939 cell treated by RNAi) was significantly lower than QBC939-BC (QBC939 cell) and QBC939-NC cells (QBC939 cell treated by scramble plasmid). The ratio of G0/1 phase cells and apoptosis rate increased in QBC939-KD cell. The proliferation activity and invasion ability decreased in QBC939-KD cell compared with QBC939-NC and QBC939-BC cells. CONCLUSIONS: ANXA5 play important role in the migration and apoptosis of CCA cells. Inhibiting the expression of ANXA5 significantly reduce the proliferation, migration and invasion ability of QBC939 cells, and increase the apoptosis of QBC939 cells.\n"}]}, "text": "OBJECTIVE: We investigated the expression of annexin A5 (ANXA5) in human cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) cell line and its effect on proliferation, migration, and apoptosis of human CCA cells.
