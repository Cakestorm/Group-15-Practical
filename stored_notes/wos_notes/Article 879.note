The ED setting and the ED employees' task perception and attitude contained both constraining and facilitating factors: ED employees saw it as their task and responsibility to help IPV victims, but their priorities were to secure a high turnover and treat acute physical problems. Although ED employees expressed openness and willingness to help, they also took the view that victims had a considerable responsibility of their own in disclosing and managing IPV, which led to ambivalent feelings.
