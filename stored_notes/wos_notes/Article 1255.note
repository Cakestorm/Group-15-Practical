{"body": "The ipomoelin gene (IPO) was identified to be a wound-inducible gene from Ipomoea batatas, and its expression was stimulated by methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and hydrogen peroxide. IPO protein was also characterized as a defence-related protein, and it is also a carbohydrate-binding protein. In this study, the expression of IPO was used as a molecular probe to study the effects of Ca2+ on the signal transduction of ethylene. A confocal microscope monitored the Ca2+ within cells, and Northern blotting examined IPO expression. The presence of Ca2+ channel blocker, including diltiazem, neomycin or ruthenium red, abolished the increase of cytosolic Ca2+, and reduced the IPO expression in the cells induced by ethylene. Furthermore, both Ca2+ influxes and IPO expression stimulated by ethylene were prohibited in the presence of 10 mM ethylene glycol-bis(2-aminoethyl ether)-N, N, N', N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA). These results indicated that Ca2+ influxes into the cytosol induced by ethylene are from both apoplast and organelles, and are required for activating IPO expression. However, in the presence of 1 mM EGTA, ethylene can still stimulate IPO expression, but mechanical wounding failed to do it. Therefore, Ca2+ channels in the plasma membrane induced by ethylene have higher affinity to Ca2+ than that stimulated by wounding. Moreover, the addition of A23187, an ionophore, raised cytosolic Ca2+, but was unable to stimulate IPO expression. These findings showed that IPO induction did not solely depend on Ca2+, and Ca2+ elevation in cytosol is necessary but not sufficient for IPO expression. The application of PD98059, a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK) inhibitor, did not prevent Ca2+ from increasing in the cytosol induced by ethylene, but inhibited the IPO expression stimulated by staurosporine (STA), a protein kinase inhibitor. Conclusively, elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ by ethylene may stimulate protein phosphatase and MAPKK, which finally activates IPO expression.\n", "embeddings": ["-1.858847", "-0.4187385", "0.73988754", "-0.3110163", "1.9338913", "-0.63230425", "0.10015781", "0.4966785", "-0.6376724", "0.5960055", "0.4602899", "-0.49185726", "-0.9073384", "0.7649343", "-0.045960374", "-1.9306353", "0.9147721", "1.3207322", "-0.0049962034", "0.6032064", "0.119824134", "-0.825802", "-1.6826099", "0.3667096", "-2.9568243", "-1.6022632", "0.65412575", "0.9125281", "-1.8152558", "0.22259158", "1.2105837", "-0.5869985", "-0.6560265", "-1.361418", "1.6543789", "-0.042911164", "1.3159434", "0.649286", "0.7273126", "0.022001289", "0.45746642", "1.2125355", "1.5410788", "-0.42241237", "-2.023596", "-1.6481463", "0.4106132", "0.27835974", "1.9483423", "0.08614222", "1.1635723", "0.17543298", "0.59644306", "-0.7782818", "1.4738628", "0.11102024", "0.01440143", "0.06296475", "-1.4762025", "0.9140792", "-1.1273627", "1.143384", "1.0811985", "0.59883374", "0.69552183", "0.56274015", "1.8762718", "2.0584261", "-0.83201814", "-0.23696461", "1.1464783", "1.2021176", "-2.0250127", "1.0713027", "0.4328748", "0.5730423", "-0.6337028", "-1.3546983", "-0.05141152", "0.60654813", "-0.08920732", "-1.0010977", "-1.2574209", "0.84366477", "-0.28215057", "-0.16765168", "0.95528007", "0.011818607", "0.1351435", "1.5897292", "1.8928107", "0.4830859", "1.0920362", "0.18095092", "0.3858708", "0.9062022", "-3.0758162", "-1.3119972", "-1.2600235", "-0.90409034", "-1.712125", "-0.12179257", "-0.25965276", "-0.87438375", "-1.6536596", "0.48480308", "-0.18427639", "-0.23759486", "-0.40413004", "0.7915005", "-1.2560182", "0.996415", "0.3078404", "0.1009216", "2.0602536", "-1.379784", "-0.26686573", "-0.55203074", "-0.70505726", "-0.08073245", "-0.19232742", "1.9934014", "1.1543062", "-0.67744124", "1.4991091", "0.49358082", "-0.21087421", "-2.145267", "-0.65379333", "0.16000584", "1.3732926", "0.82187194", "0.60988504", "-1.2077852", "-1.32095", "0.5428846", "-1.2291609", "-0.3989525", "1.0039572", "-1.7974436", "0.072175145", "-0.67402726", "-0.9229072", "-0.9794573", "-0.7120151", "0.8586808", "0.100922406", "-2.043272", "-0.13931035", "1.0632452", "-1.1869532", "-2.7014427", "-2.1210632", "0.99193287", "0.2964124", "1.602143", "0.74344754", "0.8069804", "-0.1520519", "-0.40054923", "2.3589985", "-0.06604267", "-0.80503684", "-0.73617053", "1.246366", "-0.53364784", "2.7229972", "-1.7117212", "0.47143438", "1.3585355", "-1.2276584", "0.91045916", "0.70498765", "0.47788462", "1.4471226", "-1.0970627", "0.9246409", "1.1071842", "-0.1549454", "-0.2846245", "0.97378707", "1.0206466", "-0.64065826", "1.0115477", "-0.90127003", "1.487989", "-0.30137467", "0.8800008", "1.6969836", "1.4172802", "0.65994245", "-0.5775635", "-0.31117153", "0.6580234", "0.06342823", "1.4384934", "-0.112321205", "-0.24900526", "-1.9771832", "-0.30865902"]}
