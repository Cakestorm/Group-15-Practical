{"title": "Article 987", "body": "Herein a techno-economic assessment was performed on an energy-crop-based biogas plant coupled with a greenhouse for utilizing thermal energy produced by cogeneration. Seven energy crops were evaluated: triticale, maize, alfalfa, sunflower, clover, barley and wheat. According to the evaluation, triticale was the most competitive energy crop under selected climate conditions for northern Greece. Although maize displays higher biomass yield and biogas potential than the drought-resistant crop triticale, it has high irrigation demand that contributes significantly to total production costs. For a triticale-based biogas production to become economically feasible, agricultural arable area larger than 500 ha, or biogas plant size larger than 1000 kW(el), is required. However, with public funding, biogas production becomes feasible at smaller area (>250 ha) or biogas plant size (>500 kW(el)). The inclusion of a greenhouse into the design of the biogas plant contributes positively to the economic viability of the entire system. Under this scenario, greenhouse financial income accounts for about 17-18% of total income. Results of a sensitivity analysis suggest that the selection of an appropriate energy crop for biogas production should be based principally on both digestibility (specific methane yield) and biomass yield per hectare, these factors being more critical than biomass production costs.\n", "text": "Herein a techno-economic assessment was performed on an energy-crop-based biogas plant coupled with a greenhouse for utilizing thermal energy produced by cogeneration.
