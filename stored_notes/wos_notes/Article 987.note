Although maize displays higher biomass yield and biogas potential than the drought-resistant crop triticale, it has high irrigation demand that contributes significantly to total production costs. For a triticale-based biogas production to become economically feasible, agricultural arable area larger than 500 ha, or biogas plant size larger than 1000 kW(el), is required.
