It means that there is well a gap to live and theorize and that the alcoholic is not reduced to a cerebral dysfunction: he is in the life of relation, that is it is capable of taking up himself by using its real-life experience. The psychopathology implications are going to show themselves here of a very big importance: any reduction comes to truncate the understanding of the man sick coach in reality we constantly have to deal with the \"global and complete\" man, with the anthropology of the human fate. Conclusion. - If the science brings us news discovered in this domain, it has to keep always in mind that the life remains imperceptible and deeply moving.
