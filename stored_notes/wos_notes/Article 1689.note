In this study, we aimed to investigate the impact of both hOCT1 polymorphisms located in exon 7 and hOCT1 mRNA levels on the clinical outcome in CML patients. hOCT1 expression profile was determined using the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in 69 CML patients treated with IM (35 responders to IM patients and 34 IM-resistant patients), while genotyping of 69 cases and 51 controls for hOCT1 polymorphisms was performed by direct sequencing after amplification of exon7. Our results showed that the hOCT1 gene was significantly downregulated in the samples of the IM-resistant group when compared with the IM-responder group (p = 0.0211).

The genotype and allele distribution of the different SNPs did not differ significantly between the two groups of patients. hOCT1 mRNA expression may serve as a clinical biomarker of response to imatinib and could be useful to predict IM therapy outcome of CML patients.\n"}]}, "text": "Imatinib mesylate (IM) is considered as a highly effective therapy for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients.
