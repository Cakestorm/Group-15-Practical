{"body": "Over recent decades, water conservation have become increasingly an utmost important issue for debate, and this includes the domestic sector. Reducing demand water by improving the efficiency of water use in domestic sector requires an understanding of how water is used and in what ways water savings can be realized. The focus of this global, web-based, consumer questionnaire survey was to analyze individual consumer attitudes towards using water in manual dishwashing and understand the likelihood of a prospect of changing the daily manual dishwashing method resulting to a more efficient domestic usage of water. This study was designed to investigate the manual dishwashing technique used in the 5249 households of nine different countries - China, Germany, Italy, Russia, Indonesia, Brazil, India, South Africa and Argentina. Besides socio-demographics, technical questions like cleaning steps, hygiene questions motivational question, environmental awareness questions, questions on payment for water and electricity, questions on information sources about household work were included in the study. It was found that the awareness to conserve water was common among the Asian participants but it necessarily was not practiced in the households as individual washing of dishes was found to be quite high. Among the many outcomes, important one was that running tap method' was found to be most prevalent (86%) among Russian participants, complimenting their detached approach towards conserving domestic water usage. In South American countries like Brazil (66%) and Argentina (51%), high occurrence of running tap rinse' was found to be a common practice, confirming the lack of conscious use of water in manual dishwashing in the subcontinent. Based on the overall responses, awareness of a new and efficient technique of manual dishwashing could be propagated through the most voted mediums of Internet (81%) and TV (69%).\n", "embeddings": ["-1.6583831", "-0.7859498", "1.0521988", "2.0716667", "1.2724805", "0.09301218", "-0.04520818", "2.6130126", "0.2735467", "0.8699999", "0.2052282", "-1.0455989", "0.12450655", "-1.4695866", "0.08983282", "1.1896427", "0.57558775", "-0.7184369", "0.09881651", "-0.47819304", "-0.7341612", "-1.0699415", "0.41961622", "2.3700516", "0.35667962", "0.47807872", "1.3892356", "-1.1485628", "0.0055425656", "-0.6460646", "2.1549094", "0.6756454", "-0.39931822", "-0.12723841", "-0.64897954", "-1.204332", "0.8896937", "-1.1810409", "2.0076964", "-1.149858", "-0.8184278", "1.039222", "1.5148942", "-0.5267851", "-0.20057184", "-0.8655971", "0.06515904", "-0.44282264", "1.9455245", "-0.08999337", "-0.41946617", "-1.0143869", "-0.06496344", "-0.8520621", "0.06747529", "1.2680389", "0.76646745", "-0.56258726", "-0.0010583422", "-0.27614892", "-0.2948533", "1.0303952", "1.8349261", "0.019032972", "-0.1308564", "1.0832852", "-1.4130312", "0.31877637", "-1.3352641", "2.2287197", "-0.049987007", "-0.704097", "1.4466482", "0.8029561", "-1.6419834", "-0.513379", "2.684269", "-1.9477202", "-1.0525117", "-2.065444", "-1.0778749", "-1.1800649", "-0.9936884", "-0.5058288", "0.56599504", "0.78050953", "-0.42390284", "0.32015824", "-1.269799", "1.5091316", "-0.3997173", "0.5603667", "0.2570278", "-1.3566573", "1.6527443", "1.6444364", "-0.6082526", "1.437777", "0.40138662", "1.5101746", "-1.507094", "0.21288216", "0.30525592", "0.3676926", "0.10731353", "-3.2199216", "0.9979396", "2.2761443", "-0.39351326", "-0.7251786", "0.27266592", "0.55063623", "-0.54624236", "-0.8317853", "0.26492447", "1.0831262", "0.81580395", "-1.298808", "-0.10483623", "-0.48056552", "-0.038209364", "1.4346616", "-2.4449322", "0.8044311", "-0.57992244", "1.8690761", "0.89606005", "0.3179204", "1.4717926", "0.6347427", "1.9034672", "0.6384817", "-1.6533667", "-0.50674874", "0.41429248", "2.2992728", "0.19912922", "2.2869177", "0.3383002", "-1.2301117", "-1.6665853", "0.84861577", "-0.9658051", "0.8784103", "-0.59214324", "-0.31242344", "-1.2705555", "1.3431851", "0.09114042", "-0.17024216", "-0.47321397", "-0.18289697", "0.9289399", "0.7592945", "-0.43119654", "1.7370979", "0.56303805", "-0.18977691", "0.33181363", "-1.3563478", "-0.3265217", "0.08930849", "-1.2202842", "-2.4180844", "1.0490627", "1.4442918", "-0.0045880214", "-0.23567823", "-0.6933057", "0.6102754", "1.2761753", "0.17284109", "0.7073291", "-0.29065034", "-1.8562778", "0.84083164", "0.48710904", "-1.1076852", "-0.36166134", "-1.6299546", "-0.11268321", "1.6559248", "1.2418036", "-0.11889773", "0.6061309", "-0.17568773", "-0.10017812", "0.9967822", "0.5047359", "-0.63488925", "0.43643588", "0.82206446", "-1.6098001", "-1.0018746", "-2.0607529", "-0.066795684", "-0.57258564", "0.7163719", "0.79759437", "0.5003021"]}
