{"title": "Article 2311", "body": "Pectinolytic bacteria from the genus Dickeya (former Erwinia chrysanthemi), belonging to Dickeya dianthicola and Dickeya solani species, are causative agents of blackleg and soft rot diseases in Europe. Recently, D. solani have been isolated most frequently from potato plants with the symptoms of blackleg and soft rot. D. solani strains were shown to cause more severe disease symptoms on potato plants than D. dianthicola especially at the higher temperature. They are also able to develop blackleg disease from lower inoculum levels. In the presented study we not only compared phenotypic features of fifteen D. solani strains isolated in countries having different climatic conditions, Poland, Finland and Israel, but also we examined three D. dianthicola strains. The comparison was performed to determine the influence of the strain origin and the temperature of incubation on the ability of the strains to macerate potato tissue and on their major virulence factors such as: pectinolytic, cellulolytic and proteolytic activities, siderophore production and motility. Polish D. solani strains showed higher activities of cell wall degrading enzymes than the Finnish and Israeli strains at all the tested temperatures: 18, 27, 37 A degrees C. This observation is correlated with the higher ability of Polish D. solani strains to cause soft rot. In addition, D. solani strains exhibited higher activity of the above mentioned enzymes and caused more severe potato tuber maceration in laboratory tests than the tested D. dianthicola strains. The collected results indicate that although D. solani strains from different climatic conditions have identical Pulse Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) profiles in addition to the same fingerprint profiles obtained by the repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reaction (REP, ERIC and BOX repetitive sequences), they differ in the examined phenotypic features, especially in the activities of pectinolytic, cellulolytic and proteolytic enzymes and their capacity to macerate potato tuber tissue.\n", "text": "Pectinolytic bacteria from the genus Dickeya (former Erwinia chrysanthemi), belonging to Dickeya dianthicola and Dickeya solani species, are causative agents of blackleg and soft rot diseases in Europe.
