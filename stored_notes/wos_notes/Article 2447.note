(HBV) replication and what the mechanism is. METHODS: After the human hepatoma cell line Huh7 was cotransfected with DAI and HBV expressing plasmid, viral protein (HBV surface antigen and HBV e antigen) secretion was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and HBV RNA was analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction and Northern blotting, and viral DNA replicative intermediates were examined by Southern blotting. Interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) phosphorylation and nuclear translocation were analyzed via Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining respectively. Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) activity induced by DAI was detected by immunofluorescence staining of P65 and dual luciferase reporter assay. Transwell co-culture experiment was performed in order to investigate whether the antiviral effects of DAI were dependent on the secreted cytokines. RESULTS: Viral protein secretion was significantly reduced by 57% (P < 0.05), and the level of total HBV RNA was reduced by 67% (P < 0.05). The viral core particle-associated DNA was also dramatically down-regulated in DAI-expressing Huh7 cells. Analysis of involved signaling pathways revealed that activation of NF-kappa B signaling was essential for DAI to elicit antiviral response in Huh7 cells. When the NF-kappa B signaling pathway was blocked by a NF-kappa B signaling suppressor (I kappa B alpha-SR), the anti-HBV activity of DAI was remarkably abrogated. The inhibitory effect of DAI was independent of IRF3 signaling and secreted cytokines. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that DAI can inhibit HBV replication and the inhibitory effect is associated with activation of NF-kappa B but independent of IRF3 and secreted cytokines.
