{"title": "Article 2722", "body": "Basement membranes maintain the epithelial phenotype and prevent invasion and metastasis. We hypothesized that expression of basement membrane laminins might be regulated by epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), hallmark of cancer progression. As EMT is mediated by transcription factor Snail, we used oral squamous carcinoma cells obtained from a primary tumor (43A), from its EMT-experienced recurrence (43B) and Snail-transfected 43A cells (43A-SNA) displaying full EMT, as a model to study laminins and their receptors. Northern blotting, immunofluorescence, and immunoprecipitation showed a gradual loss of laminin-511 and its receptor Lutheran from 43A to 43B and 43A-SNA cells. In contrast, neoexpression of laminin alpha 4 mRNA was found congruent with synthesis of laminin-411. Chromatin immunoprecipitation disclosed direct binding of Snail to regions upstream of laminin alpha 5 and alpha 4 genes. Immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation showed a switch from hemidesmosomal integrin alpha(6)beta(4) to alpha(6)beta(1) and neoexpression of alpha(1)beta(1) in 43A-SNA cells, and upregulation of integrin-linked kinase in both 43B and 43A-SNA cells. The cells adhered potently to laminin-511 and fibronectin, whereas adhesion to laminin-411 was minimal. In contrast, laminin-411 inhibited cell adhesion to other extracellular matrix proteins. In conclusion, EMT induces a switch from laminin-511 to laminin-411 expression, which may be directly controlled by Snail. Concomitant changes take place in laminin- and collagen-binding receptors. Laminin-411 reduces adhesion to laminin-511 and fibronectin, suggesting that tumor cells could utilize laminin-411 in their invasive behavior.\n", "text": "Basement membranes maintain the epithelial phenotype and prevent invasion and metastasis.
