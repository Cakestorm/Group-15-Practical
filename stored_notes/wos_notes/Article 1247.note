The time required to reduce the amount of virus by 2.57 logic, (t(d)) on survival plots of NoV determined using a modified Weibull model was 2445 days at 4 degrees C and 138 days at 10 degrees C. These results indicate that NoV from food preparation or processing is able to persistently survive in Kimchi. Therefore, preventing NoV transmission is important for protecting Kimchi against NoV contamination. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
