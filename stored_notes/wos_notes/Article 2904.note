{"body": "Recent attention to communities \"localizing\" food systems has increased the need to understand the perspectives of people working to foster collaboration and the eventual transformation of the food system. University Cooperative Extension Educators (EEs) increasingly play a critical role in communities' food systems across the United States, providing various resources to address local needs. A better understanding of EEs' perspectives on food systems is therefore important. Inspired by the work of Stevenson, Ruhf, Lezberg, and Clancy on the social food movement, we conducted national virtual focus groups to examine EEs' attitudes about how food system change should happen, for what reasons, and who has the resources, power, and influence to effect change. The institutions within which EEs are embedded shape their perceptions of available resources in the community, including authority and power (and who holds them). These resources, in turn, structure EEs' goals and strategies for food system change. We find that EEs envision working within the current food system: building market-centric alternatives that address inequity for vulnerable consumers and producers. EEs bring many resources to the table but do not believe they can influence those who have the authority to change policy. While these findings could suggest EEs' limited ability to be transformative change agents, EEs can potentially connect their efforts with new partners that share perceptions of food system problems and solutions. As EEs increasingly engage in food system work and with increasingly diverse stakeholders, they can access alternative, transformational frames within which to set goals and organize their work.\n", "embeddings": ["0.6129553", "-0.6606233", "-0.48391464", "1.7654955", "-0.11459611", "-0.3019273", "1.4694957", "0.9781705", "-0.14114197", "1.2850045", "-0.61125386", "-1.8918034", "0.075661786", "0.2308772", "-0.5832961", "0.2975388", "0.24798019", "1.2638658", "-0.35158777", "-1.2966948", "0.23827134", "-0.1448484", "-0.35284206", "0.7783734", "-0.10227959", "1.6728332", "-0.404574", "-0.4425147", "-2.685439", "-1.5064532", "-0.20021182", "0.5125683", "-0.7411667", "-1.4482177", "0.5566049", "-1.3889909", "1.4198309", "0.17718382", "1.784976", "-3.964491", "-1.7233627", "-0.6021212", "0.33824173", "-2.6322107", "1.5003437", "-0.8720145", "-0.94734484", "0.6890877", "-0.14721096", "0.4713773", "-0.0976612", "0.32760146", "1.4979455", "-2.6547427", "1.5646697", "-0.44683105", "1.2291613", "-0.034503315", "-0.29784712", "2.023908", "-0.2501714", "-0.09814278", "-0.6462336", "-2.0734801", "2.7567136", "-0.09597563", "0.6594386", "1.0888569", "-0.6926191", "1.2966325", "-0.21109478", "-0.5900479", "0.47581008", "-0.065716065", "0.99552286", "-1.1711943", "0.47644675", "1.1437683", "0.26710704", "-1.3979368", "-0.81110066", "-0.87260365", "-0.8554635", "1.675931", "1.2172731", "1.4796383", "-0.5905238", "-2.0618258", "0.44672754", "2.4299624", "0.13553397", "-0.3976289", "1.0573612", "0.72730577", "0.6186001", "0.3937586", "0.32904503", "0.23541762", "0.810133", "-0.41047555", "0.2886192", "-0.08686161", "-0.7537167", "-0.82351077", "-1.1932707", "-2.028242", "2.042525", "1.981679", "-0.69869804", "-1.4083076", "1.405904", "0.8322031", "-1.920683", "-1.4168881", "-0.57483786", "0.8856419", "-0.3314665", "-1.7250315", "1.1902753", "1.4821737", "0.43244758", "1.0613703", "1.7779003", "1.0268507", "-1.0841947", "-0.052850656", "-0.9948004", "-1.3920633", "0.8883724", "0.29265797", "1.0397046", "-0.2343713", "0.97398597", "-0.646284", "1.3336804", "1.5369165", "-2.8005168", "-0.4756566", "-2.5376604", "-1.3719326", "0.8166486", "0.01593043", "-0.9042744", "-2.6393015", "-0.57525164", "1.7004818", "-0.9994644", "2.5263832", "1.3026522", "1.5130608", "0.34808376", "-0.8664657", "1.5193722", "-0.8583817", "-0.72726977", "0.78225845", "-2.100068", "1.3514215", "0.6287176", "-0.44486976", "-0.014895928", "1.2454784", "-1.5831951", "-0.946832", "0.5000274", "0.9898336", "1.1301101", "-1.9434607", "0.5420934", "-0.62433845", "-1.0005784", "0.8309911", "1.3899376", "-0.35909382", "-1.9858629", "0.34170076", "-1.0463773", "-0.94038635", "0.30459118", "-1.2026885", "0.52786636", "0.49617654", "0.7324771", "1.970467", "0.5529464", "-0.815499", "-0.36575273", "0.13370241", "0.40100026", "0.7207636", "0.8551045", "1.8690428", "0.36260188", "0.15607454", "-0.040726554", "-0.1612032", "0.04429161", "2.551915", "-0.91815233", "1.054334"]}
