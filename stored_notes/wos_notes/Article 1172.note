{"title": "Article 1172", "body": {"ops": [{"insert": "Recent advances in our understanding of the molecular biology of epithelial ovarian cancer have led to the development of a number of targeted therapies, including poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors.

Early studies have shown significant efficacy for PARP inhibitors in patients with germline BRCA1/2 mutations.
