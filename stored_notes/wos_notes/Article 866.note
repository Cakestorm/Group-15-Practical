{"title": "Article 866", "body": "This study had the aim to identify and relat the occurrence of billfish larvae and eggs in the Southeastern coast of Brazil. During the summer in two seasons (2012/2013 and 2013/2014) 74 surface trawls were done using an ichthyoplankton net off the coast of Vitoria-ES, Rio de Janeiro-RJ and Ilhabela-SP and 391 fish larvae were collected. The identification of the billfish larvae was done by molecular biology using the DNA barcode (COI gene). During the 2012/2013 season, five sailfish and two white marlin larvae were identified and in the 2013/2014 season, two sailfishes, two white marlin larvae and two swordfish eggs were identified. The occurrence of billfish larvae shall be further studied, so that inferences about the area and period of spawning and development of early life stages of these fish can be made more accurately.\n", "text": "This study had the aim to identify and relat the occurrence of billfish larvae and eggs in the Southeastern coast of Brazil.
