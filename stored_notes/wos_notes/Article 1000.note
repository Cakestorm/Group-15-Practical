{"title": "Article 1000", "body": "Sclerospora graminicola (Sacc.) Schroet., an oomycete pathogen of Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br. infects the meristematic tissues of young seedlings. The motile zoospores from the sporangia encyst, germinate and penetrate the plant tissue. Resistance to the invading pathogen is governed by the specific recognition of conserved pathogen-associated proteins or elicitors. In the present study, a zoospore protein was isolated and purified to homogeneity by a combination of size exclusion and high-performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC). The crude fractionated protein was able to elicit an array of defence responses in resistant and susceptible cells of pearl millet. Treatment of cultured cells of pearl millet with partially purified elicitor protein resulted in a rapid loss of cell viability in the resistant cells and the percentage of cell death was higher in the resistant than in the susceptible cells. Cultures of resistant cells showed a sharp increase in the extra cellular pH compared with susceptible cells when treated with the crude elicitor. Increased oxidative burst was also recorded in the cells treated with the crude elicitor. The purified elicitor showed unique properties. The purified protein was acidic with a pI of 5.6 as revealed by isoelectric focusing (IEF) and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation (MALDI) analysis showed that the elicitor had a molecular mass of 7040 daltons. The primary structure determined by N-terminal Edman degradation and searches with BLAST did not reveal similarities to any known plant pathogenic or oomycete elicitor. Higher activities of the important defence-related enzymes phenylalanine ammonia lyase ( PAL) and peroxidase in the resistant cell cultures than in the susceptible cell cultures treated with the purified elicitor were clearly evident. Studies of gene expression by northern blotting with heterologus peroxidase, PAL and oxalate oxidase probes showed that the mRNA transcripts were strongly up-regulated in resistant cell cultures within 30 min of elicitor treatment. The purified elicitor also demonstrated a very strong concentration-dependent sterol binding. The purified elicitor protein belongs to a class of low molecular weight oomycete elicitors with sterol carrier properties. The identified low molecular weight protein elicitor displays unique properties that can be exploited for synthesis of novel molecules for eco-friendly crop protection.\n", "text": "Sclerospora graminicola (Sacc.)
