{"title": "Article 1733", "body": "Electricity is the basic tool that drives industrialization, technological advancement, engineering transformation and economic growth all over the world. The situation of Nigeria's electricity power sector is one that has defied virtually every effort made to resurrect it from its state of dilapidation. A major concern is \"can there ever be stable and cost effective electricity in Nigeria?\" The authors are positive this can be realised, but not without considering other forms of electricity energy resources available in Nigeria other than the conventional sources of electricity which is currently the mainstay. A deliberate transition from conventional sources of electricity energy to renewable and environmental friendly sources is critical for national development, even though recent development show the Nigerian government is backsliding in adopting renewable energy technologies. This paper will be used to highlight the different sources of renewable energy which is critical to solve the lingering problem of electricity generation in Nigeria. Hence, based on the literature, modeled scenarios and field experience, the authors discovered it is much easier for individuals to drive this transition to 100% renewable energy than to continue to depend on government forever.\n", "text": "Electricity is the basic tool that drives industrialization, technological advancement, engineering transformation and economic growth all over the world.
