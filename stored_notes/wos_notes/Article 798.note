{"title": "Article 798", "body": "Short-chain enoyl-CoA hydratase (SCEH) is a mitochondrial enzyme involved in the oxidation of fatty acids and the catabolic pathway of valine and, to a lesser extent, isoleucine. Deficiency of this enzyme was recently shown to cause an early childhood Leigh syndrome phenotype. The few reported patients were compound heterozygotes for two missense or missense with truncating variants in ECHS1 that encodes SCEH. We describe two siblings with severe refractory lactic acidosis and death within the first 2 days of life. Following negative clinical whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing, we resorted to autozygome/exome analysis on research basis and identified a homozygous splice site mutation (c.88+5G>A) in the two cases. Analysis of cDNA confirmed complete replacement of the normal transcript with an aberrant transcript (r.88_89ins 88+1_88+11) predicting premature truncation of the protein [p.(Ala31Glufs*23)]. Furthermore, quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) showed marked reduction in ECHS1, most likely nonsense-mediated decay (NMD)-mediated. This is the first report of homozygosity for a truncating mutation in ECHS1, which may explain the severe phenotype. Our report highlights the need to consider SCEH deficiency in patients with lethal neonatal lactic acidosis, and the potentially limited sensitivity of untargeted genomic sequencing towards non-canonical splicing mutations, which may explain at least some of the negative' cases on clinical exome/genome sequencing.\n", "text": "Short-chain enoyl-CoA hydratase (SCEH) is a mitochondrial enzyme involved in the oxidation of fatty acids and the catabolic pathway of valine and, to a lesser extent, isoleucine.
