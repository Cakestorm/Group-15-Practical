{"body": "The current study tested the hypothesis that mothers who have experienced child maltreatment and aggression within their adult relationships may be at particular risk for misinterpreting infant emotions, leading to less sensitive parenting behaviors. Participants were 120 pregnant women recruited for a larger, longitudinal study investigating the role of psychosocial and environmental risk on women and their young children. Data were collected during the third trimester of pregnancy, and when children were 1 and 2 years of age. Participants completed a projective test designed to elicit individual differences in perceptions of infant emotions and an observer-rated assessment of parenting behaviors was conducted in the family home. Using structural equation modeling, we tested associations between maternal interpersonal aggression exposure and perceptions of infant emotion and parenting behaviors. Results demonstrated that a history of child abuse and intimate partner conflict were associated with a maternal tendency to view ambiguous infant facial expressions as negative (i.e., negative attribution bias), and in turn, with less parenting sensitivity over time. Findings suggest that negative attributions of infant emotion may be 1 mechanism by which a history of trauma and violence exposure contributes to less sensitive parenting for some mothers. Implications for intervention include the need for trauma-informed clinical services and psychoeducational methods that help mothers more accurately read and respond to infant emotional expression and bids for connection.\n", "embeddings": ["1.3183848", "-0.0010496627", "-0.2931485", "0.083890855", "0.045921303", "0.5222146", "0.5243902", "0.8460919", "-0.80119145", "-0.5325901", "-0.7148891", "-1.3703161", "1.2813312", "-0.89845943", "-0.3424489", "-0.28892902", "0.72804606", "-0.98571193", "0.010985591", "-0.1146586", "1.7225171", "0.12780245", "-1.2758365", "-0.88965076", "0.65956175", "0.8080758", "-0.25755426", "-0.5470745", "0.29198948", "-1.814746", "1.3775972", "0.63773793", "-0.6229743", "-0.38844165", "0.7251531", "0.70549697", "-0.28601265", "-0.22417144", "0.77688366", "0.6645843", "-0.26753274", "0.3023739", "-0.6679634", "-1.7637081", "0.74970514", "-0.80177784", "-0.89192367", "0.20825745", "-1.2619298", "1.080662", "1.1236598", "-2.0776262", "2.0086029", "-2.2025836", "-1.4623914", "0.19161394", "0.07000923", "0.6882172", "0.31694895", "-1.3946742", "-0.4367088", "1.8400021", "0.56185156", "1.0328579", "-0.5967427", "1.0602133", "0.02260563", "2.063431", "0.30310073", "-0.00982638", "-1.1085225", "0.6481909", "-0.94058764", "-0.50630313", "1.0830437", "0.57900065", "1.3405484", "-2.5005946", "-2.1159992", "0.5416302", "-0.5543446", "-0.14823365", "0.4816487", "0.6367609", "-0.97908217", "0.33831486", "-0.67325145", "-0.7642725", "0.4913152", "1.2714632", "0.74002165", "1.0627", "1.8011068", "-0.32477215", "-0.26390943", "0.8832331", "1.7634314", "-0.49560285", "-0.609454", "-1.3430598", "-0.28017822", "1.2083251", "0.7244562", "0.9413366", "-0.3710406", "-1.2903969", "-0.12902823", "1.489475", "0.1849031", "-0.5125438", "0.19314967", "-1.4464256", "0.3520712", "-0.9028535", "-0.7025477", "-0.27259308", "1.7461798", "-1.5262386", "1.285634", "0.33653057", "-0.5790497", "0.10825204", "1.3244689", "0.41004938", "-0.35232657", "-0.75944823", "-0.6106084", "0.7707124", "-0.81828916", "-0.44263685", "1.2114441", "-0.6179701", "0.16324389", "-0.5652954", "-0.7355813", "-1.5980428", "-1.0755951", "-0.37947443", "-0.20249245", "-0.34228775", "0.20861903", "0.06389707", "-1.3062487", "-1.2131991", "0.32312927", "0.7932347", "-1.3309475", "0.6755138", "1.1384184", "-0.01297424", "0.3243843", "0.22891277", "-0.7276742", "0.18302217", "-1.7614437", "0.59841365", "-0.39614773", "0.63492084", "1.0787705", "-0.9131498", "-0.72809196", "-0.9064296", "-0.19594246", "-0.88174224", "-1.0845487", "1.3686031", "-1.2516239", "0.478038", "-0.231436", "-0.12672488", "0.06112405", "0.92281014", "-0.27122492", "-0.0795047", "0.21306673", "-0.5308764", "0.3146454", "-1.0202814", "-0.48112875", "-0.07052611", "-1.3202888", "1.5053177", "0.6454735", "0.626462", "0.13275445", "-0.37426502", "0.07943376", "-1.2103626", "1.3200684", "0.5674136", "1.2297659", "-1.7480153", "-0.6412653", "-0.2538833", "-0.82184714", "1.3138678", "0.053355996", "-0.65519625", "-0.6144392", "-0.36401373"]}
