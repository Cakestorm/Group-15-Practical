EGFR-PLC gamma 1 signaling mediates high glucose-induced PKC beta 1-Akt activation and collagen I upregulation in mesangial cells. Am J Physiol Renal Physiol 297: F822-F834, 2009. First published July 15, 2009; doi:10.1152/ajprenal.00054.2009.-Glomerular matrix accumulation is a hallmark of diabetic nephropathy. We have recently shown that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) transactivation mediates high glucose (HG)-induced collagen I upregulation through PI3K-PKC beta 1-Akt signaling in mesangial cells (MC). Phospholipase C gamma 1 (PLC gamma 1) interacts with activated growth factor receptors and activates classic PKC isoforms. We thus studied its role in HG-induced collagen I upregulation in MC. Primary rat MC were treated with HG (30 mM) or mannitol as osmotic control. Protein kinase activation was assessed by Western blotting and collagen I upregulation by Northern blotting. Diabetes was induced in rats by streptozotocin. HG treatment for 1 h led to PLC gamma 1 membrane translocation and Y783 phosphorylation, both indicative of its activation. Mannitol was without effect. PLC gamma 1 Y783 phosphorylation was also seen in cortex and glomeruli of diabetic rats. HG induced a physical association between EGFR and PLC gamma 1 as identified by coimmuno-precipitation. PLC gamma 1 activation required EGFR kinase activity since it was prevented by the EGFR inhibitor AG1478 or overexpression of kinase-inactive EGFR (K721A). Phosphoinositide-3-OH kinase inhibition also prevented PLC gamma 1 activation. HG-induced Akt S473 phosphorylation, effected by PKC beta 1, was inhibited by the PLC gamma inhibitor U73122. PLC gamma 1 inhibition or downregulation by small interference RNA also prevented HG-induced collagen I upregulation. Our results indicate that EGFR-PLC gamma 1 signaling mediates HG-induced PKC beta 1-Akt activation and subsequent collagen I upregulation in MC. Inhibition of EGFR or PLC gamma 1 may provide attractive therapeutic targets for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy.\n", "embeddings": ["-1.1162138", "0.27395812", "0.92710584", "-1.2026042", "0.79107416", "-2.1147017", "-0.7888509", "0.6541897", "-1.8626022", "0.05034999", "1.0193764", "-0.6436074", "-0.024348838", "0.808701", "-1.7466631", "0.02528942", "0.5235586", "-0.34305924", "-0.22474058", "-0.54736066", "0.24941759", "-0.25928703", "-0.91611755", "-0.5724378", "-1.184646", "-1.8633229", "-0.17480616", "1.2439128", "-2.2038567", "0.29003993", "0.4651742", "1.0838765", "0.25474238", "-1.3074496", "0.31592584", "0.8943356", "0.29970592", "-0.47607395", "-0.5683699", "0.48351115", "-1.282679", "0.17228407", "-0.19303255", "-0.48008633", "0.55131465", "0.1364592", "-0.9525378", "-1.0021589", "0.807427", "0.24605617", "0.40091127", "0.6376548", "0.8888194", "-1.3141186", "-0.15027231", "-0.15099034", "-1.6221235", "-1.365665", "-1.9901997", "1.2426126", "0.36635262", "-0.20066677", "0.69602853", "-0.40803054", "1.0317818", "1.0177869", "0.2201828", "1.4385773", "0.48489657", "-0.6849286", "1.5293773", "-0.019696334", "-0.18960978", "1.8241957", "0.07444333", "1.2699172", "-0.11198238", "-0.61857235", "-1.6509848", "-0.23456763", "-1.2235235", "0.2894005", "-0.9925386", "1.3753523", "-2.4451697", "-0.90474695", "2.169969", "1.3442413", "-0.13060364", "0.45826304", "1.4857476", "1.6712368", "0.5347559", "0.33874086", "-0.48194823", "0.4245564", "-1.3923852", "-1.8257877", "-0.21667041", "0.10462924", "-1.2358143", "1.0027217", "0.3828738", "-1.5058452", "-0.035054285", "-0.98625237", "0.24159475", "0.21758193", "-0.7995883", "-2.465708", "-1.8830189", "-0.7690392", "-0.23117983", "-0.82016885", "1.465397", "-3.2768319", "-0.24418065", "-1.8560339", "-1.1007557", "-0.9615042", "-1.974685", "0.5908873", "-0.7300525", "-1.109379", "-0.11893898", "1.2325069", "-0.45522675", "-1.1388494", "0.06820442", "-0.22135289", "0.4633116", "-0.6198066", "-1.01097", "-0.19100921", "0.77533686", "0.8421448", "-0.85583097", "-0.7106225", "-1.7122651", "-1.3703637", "0.49866393", "1.1346922", "0.81376094", "0.4679418", "1.0981911", "-0.13232967", "-0.3007105", "-0.74401027", "-0.6624434", "1.3708255", "0.75546944", "-2.7456086", "-1.9307652", "0.9686042", "-1.5990453", "-0.61965746", "1.6408408", "0.5842229", "-1.009791", "-0.90695125", "1.4822024", "0.12589005", "0.041847426", "1.4186306", "-0.4203467", "-0.9856983", "0.18416888", "-0.09410851", "-0.49329096", "-0.87734234", "0.04545452", "0.8952766", "-1.0151588", "-0.005462417", "0.82104534", "0.16090655", "0.32961616", "1.6381881", "-0.16277571", "-0.10783347", "-0.4626638", "-0.7684638", "0.49362466", "-0.24103121", "-0.49290487", "0.16966578", "0.54218155", "1.7183928", "0.17979223", "0.8937958", "1.1465695", "0.28879428", "1.0450953", "0.9358303", "1.4169596", "0.13964976", "0.80329424", "0.6764674", "1.1827836", "0.39257914"]}
