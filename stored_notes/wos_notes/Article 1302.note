{"body": "Canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2) comprises three antigenic subtypes (2a, 2b and 2c) that have been reported in many countries. These subtypes cause serious disease in dogs with characteristic gastroenteritis signs. Little information has been documented in Africa about the genetic characterization of CPV-2. The aim of this study was to detect and to characterize the CPV-2 subtypes circulating in dogs admitted to Veterinary Clinics from two cities of Mozambique, Maputo and Matola, in 2010. A total of 40 field fecal samples were collected and tested for CPV-2 by polymerase chain reaction assay. The partial length VP2 gene of the positive samples were sequenced and genetically analyzed. Twenty-six (65%) fecal samples were positive for CPV-2. The restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis was also performed from positive samples and did not reveal the presence of CPV-2c subtype. The results of the sequencing revealed the presence of CPV-2a (n = 9) and CPV-2b (n = 17). No CPV-2 and CPV-2c were detected. Sequence analysis comparison showed nucleotide identities of 99.6-100% among our CPV-2 isolates. Amino acid analysis showed predicted amino acid changes. Phylogenetically, all of the CPV-2a strains isolated formed a cluster together with South African and Nigerian isolates. Most of Mozambican CPV-2b isolates also tended to cluster together with South African isolates; however, four were more closely related to French strain and one isolates to the American strain. The present study was the first to characterize the CPV-2 circulating in the Mozambican dog population.\n", "embeddings": ["1.8448809", "-0.9123421", "1.602646", "-0.8144599", "1.2861956", "0.39910635", "0.7199852", "0.11363356", "0.8200686", "-0.7761436", "0.06044525", "0.04292392", "-1.2763299", "-0.1312071", "-0.059330367", "-1.0651135", "-1.0881543", "1.5186801", "0.7408673", "-2.1152234", "-2.194594", "-0.81644416", "0.36965835", "0.8341592", "-0.055824157", "-0.13274027", "0.09701906", "-0.3755139", "-1.2682377", "-1.7563521", "1.050777", "0.099833", "-0.47180146", "-0.39767066", "-0.25367352", "-0.027998034", "-0.010625171", "-0.6964582", "-0.33617842", "-0.61915696", "0.008370527", "0.71564806", "-0.04297553", "-1.382601", "0.09795012", "0.2886708", "-0.7874283", "0.06187199", "0.48476955", "-1.3032436", "0.4989191", "0.14474383", "0.017131146", "0.39957124", "0.16683006", "0.096124455", "0.0019623179", "-1.1123103", "0.69256914", "0.9931646", "2.2484736", "0.8610202", "-0.35271704", "0.20130442", "-0.6635942", "1.0899303", "0.76713645", "1.6258681", "0.021231674", "1.2731773", "0.026676258", "1.9500837", "1.127298", "0.98724765", "1.1587884", "-0.08085711", "-0.12774009", "-0.0116361985", "0.2407972", "-1.3151095", "-0.62613016", "0.18516119", "-0.78611237", "0.09128541", "-0.5813211", "-0.23002867", "-1.6670908", "-0.13295905", "-0.6590723", "-0.7253262", "0.47775525", "0.21247558", "0.4902979", "-0.5129681", "1.9467926", "-1.7761023", "-0.49269858", "1.2959062", "0.081939094", "-0.19161485", "-0.30640268", "-0.74033993", "-0.565726", "0.02450037", "-0.40760478", "-0.9818348", "-0.9143322", "1.3164883", "-0.9413367", "-1.1895022", "0.011215911", "-0.050331287", "-0.72888243", "0.35298154", "0.6734337", "0.35718256", "-0.9145371", "-1.4061778", "1.3756262", "0.6051485", "1.2972351", "-0.5841352", "1.0673093", "0.49068266", "-1.2249526", "1.272768", "0.22832517", "-0.054316033", "0.14523967", "0.7522227", "2.434065", "0.94684035", "-1.0926557", "-0.768593", "-1.2431475", "0.9128745", "-0.14905933", "-0.45034033", "-0.6190058", "-2.1346977", "0.3988822", "-0.37994292", "-0.4726715", "0.8360809", "-1.977295", "-0.63065577", "-0.36817807", "0.07361304", "-0.98313737", "0.071737714", "-0.97939724", "-0.27794284", "1.382414", "0.33343846", "0.07976821", "2.0572927", "0.4239222", "1.509421", "0.25465623", "-0.5322905", "-0.5547906", "0.59477025", "-0.54450864", "1.2950107", "-1.7673321", "-0.16179758", "1.4612921", "-1.9181541", "0.95133096", "1.8749851", "0.59265983", "0.29816353", "0.3838539", "1.8465008", "0.9479543", "0.53399515", "-0.24364832", "0.19099048", "1.5865581", "-0.4980793", "-1.0626659", "0.7463703", "2.0599382", "1.1773775", "-0.82752734", "-0.03629312", "-0.98609287", "-0.79497594", "0.8443149", "-1.7622693", "0.10089195", "-0.41690335", "-2.1343596", "-0.015922548", "0.13272691", "0.24875621", "0.09281296", "-1.7836846", "-0.7609654", "-0.3389905"]}
