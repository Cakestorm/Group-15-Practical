{"title": "Article 2702", "body": "Envelope tracking (ET) and envelope elimination and restoration (EER) are techniques that have gained in importance in the last decade in order to obtain highly efficient radio frequency power amplifier that transmits signals with high peak-to-average power ratio. In this study, a multilevel multiphase buck converter is presented as a solution for the envelope amplifier used in ET and EER. The presented multiphase buck converter generates multilevel voltage using \"node\" duty cycles and nonlinear control. In this way, the multilevel is implemented using only one simple power stage. However, the complexity of the multilevel converter implementation has been shifted from complicated power topologies to complicated digital control. Detailed discussion regarding the influence of the design parameters (switching frequency, output filter, and time resolution of the digital control) on the performance of the proposed envelope amplifier is presented. The design of the output filter is conducted fulfilling the constraints of the envelope slew rate and minimum driver pulse that can be reproduced. In the cases when these two constraints cannot be fulfilled, they may be relieved by the modified control that is presented and experimentally validated. Finally, in order to validate the concept, a prototype has been designed and integrated with a nonlinear class F amplifier. Efficiency measurements showed that by employing EER, it is possible to save up to 15% of power losses, comparing to the case when it is supplied by a constant voltage. Additionally, adjacent channel power ratio has been measured. The obtained results showed the value higher than 30 dB for signals up to 5 MHz of bandwidth, without using a predistortion technique.\n", "text": "Envelope tracking (ET) and envelope elimination and restoration (EER) are techniques that have gained in importance in the last decade in order to obtain highly efficient radio frequency power amplifier that transmits signals with high peak-to-average power ratio.
