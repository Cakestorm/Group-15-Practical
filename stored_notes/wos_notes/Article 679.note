We have showed that three traditional internal reference genes, beta-actin, GAPDH and a-tubulin, are not suitable for studying gene transcription in colon cancer cells treated with aspirin, and we have identified and validated TMEM208 and PQLC2 as the ideal internal reference genes for detecting the molecular targets of aspirin in colon cancer in vitro and in vivo. This study reveals stable internal reference genes for studying the target genes of aspirin in colon cancer, which will contribute to identify the molecular mechanism behind aspirin preventing colon cancer.\n"}]}, "text": "Numerous evidences indicate that aspirin usage causes a significant reduction in colorectal cancer.
