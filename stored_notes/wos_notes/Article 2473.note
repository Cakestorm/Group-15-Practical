{"title": "Article 2473", "body": "Surface characteristics play a special role for the biological performance of implants and several strategies are available to this end. The OGI (Osteo Growth Induction) titanium surface is a surface, obtained by applying a strong acid onto the blasted surface. The aim of this in-vitro study is to evaluate in vitro the osteoproperties of OGI surfaces on Mesenchymal Stem cells derived from dental pulp. Our results confirm that this treatment exert a positive effect on mitochondrial homeostasis, as shown by a decrease in ROS production related to environmental stress on the mitochondria. Morphological and molecular biology analyses confirmed more over that the DPSC cultured on the OGI surfaces appeared more spread in comparison to those grown on control titanium surface and real time PCR and biochemical data clearly demonstrated the increase of osteoconductive properties of the OGI treatment. In conclusion, our results suggest that mesenchymal stem cells sensitively respond to surface properties related to OGI treatment enhancing their osteogenic activities. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.
