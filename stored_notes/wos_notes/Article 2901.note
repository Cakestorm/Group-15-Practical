{"body": "The diagnosis of food allergy is challenging due to different immunologic mechanisms and diversity of symptoms. An open or double-blinded oral food challenge (OFC) was performed on 391 children (aged 0.2-16.9 years) with suspected cow's milk (n = 266) or wheat allergy (n = 125) to characterize immediate, delayed, and transient symptoms, and to evaluate the role of earlier food-related symptoms and immunoglobulin E (IgE)-[pmediated sensitization for the OFC outcome. The OFC resulted in an immediate positive reaction in 38% (n = 148) and a delayed positive reaction in 21% (n = 81) of the 391 children. Transient reactions, the majority of which were localized skin reactions, were seen in almost third (n = 50) of the patients with a negative OFC result (n = 162/391). Immediate localized skin reactions were more common during the milk challenge (p = 0.010), whereas immediate lower respiratory tract symptoms (p = 0.001) were more common during the wheat challenge. Although 14% (n = 21) of those with an immediate reaction received i.m. adrenalin as a treatment of the reaction, there were no life-threatening events. Multivariate analyses revealed that independent risk factors for the immediate OFC outcome were earlier moderate-to-severe immediate food-related reactions, marked IgE-mediated sensitization to the suspected food, and in case of wheat, age <12 months. The accuracy of OFCs can be enhanced without increasing the risk of serious allergic reactions by taking into account earlier food-related symptoms and the level of IgE-mediated sensitization, by refining our knowledge of transient nonspecific reactions, and by applying standardized OFC protocols with over-one-day challenges.\n", "embeddings": ["0.30169374", "-2.0478723", "0.15309004", "0.71143293", "1.0830642", "0.07386884", "-0.07876913", "-0.7740507", "-0.46898884", "0.051260035", "-0.79927707", "-1.0229627", "0.8061462", "0.8780143", "-0.16332375", "0.3041886", "0.42085773", "1.539393", "-1.204317", "-1.2556299", "-0.31220216", "0.39784497", "0.86974776", "1.1284047", "-0.07942044", "1.7925823", "0.5628384", "-0.0020994223", "-0.288398", "-1.4846382", "0.37002155", "0.123781145", "-0.14386263", "1.1111348", "-0.21601672", "-1.0259088", "1.2185248", "0.55839753", "1.5391009", "-0.47506225", "0.29030392", "0.12128992", "0.012621322", "-0.0933409", "2.4247375", "-0.26864564", "0.39646152", "-0.3650521", "-0.8138947", "0.2823734", "1.8696204", "0.4870217", "0.8882822", "-0.8085003", "-1.2779791", "1.038256", "-1.9746387", "0.12342167", "-0.4107422", "-1.3770303", "0.7790392", "0.50150347", "-1.2563868", "-1.6308292", "-0.2027856", "0.29234663", "-0.05799787", "1.2886207", "0.43776232", "1.8427716", "-0.38911512", "1.2286675", "1.2466192", "0.7826508", "1.510557", "0.49547437", "0.423412", "-1.8953643", "-1.5067644", "2.460938", "-1.2805963", "-2.121339", "-0.78677315", "0.9114818", "-0.4147244", "0.76758677", "1.1751612", "-1.0076355", "-0.0924792", "2.0907729", "0.7187949", "0.81543183", "-1.7527299", "0.3872256", "-1.031868", "1.0700499", "-0.34894204", "0.61754966", "1.5998976", "-0.5104113", "0.5744858", "1.4134568", "-0.35525954", "-1.0031238", "0.05312894", "-1.9545037", "-0.3338129", "1.3120362", "-1.2196718", "-1.2639322", "0.38916412", "-1.0488468", "-1.7418499", "-1.0159912", "1.1128752", "-0.68544215", "0.7173691", "-0.13087481", "0.8113877", "-1.0860445", "0.6936862", "2.202494", "0.012029894", "1.4567698", "-1.4451413", "-0.17315854", "0.43887937", "0.007886179", "1.0251129", "2.3280096", "-0.01636356", "-0.67982066", "1.2065051", "-0.089169666", "-2.5896683", "0.31162328", "1.8962187", "0.360464", "-1.5055614", "-1.1057552", "0.18235052", "0.60570157", "-0.9705781", "-0.81867695", "-1.0041602", "-0.028973086", "-0.010265729", "0.21029738", "0.18946126", "0.36743185", "-1.551049", "-0.13283072", "0.13519229", "0.985113", "-0.78723043", "2.3224108", "-0.5223386", "0.2806249", "-1.1732996", "-2.0295234", "-1.964621", "1.4295255", "-1.3003144", "-0.94429475", "0.5577401", "-0.8365509", "1.857963", "0.81438935", "-0.053425018", "0.6376308", "-1.182931", "-0.78742486", "0.23480737", "-0.09370399", "-0.5757289", "0.68073237", "-1.7153915", "0.4571052", "0.57974315", "-1.1460754", "-0.18173848", "0.009101535", "-0.17889637", "-0.22215085", "0.24728514", "-1.4781889", "-0.50190425", "1.106262", "0.3811898", "0.08163973", "2.6792445", "-1.7900944", "-2.1858022", "1.365122", "-0.012226368", "-0.74992645", "0.83630645", "-1.2921154", "0.71249807", "0.30296412"]}
