{"title": "Article 2039", "body": {"ops": [{"insert": "Lectin is regarded as a potential molecule involved in immune recognition and phagocytosis through opsonization in crustacean. Knowledge on lectin at molecular level would help us to understand its regulation mechanism in crustacean immune system. A novel C-type lectin gene (Fclectin) was cloned from hemocytes of Chinese shrimp Fenneropenaeus chinensis by 3' and 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) PCR. The full-length cDNA consists of 1482 bp with an 861 bp open reading frame, encoding 287 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence contains a putative signal peptide of 19 amino acids. It also contains two carbohydrate recognition domains/C-type lectin-like domains (CRD1 and CRD2), which share 78% identity with each other. CRD1 and CRD2 showed 34% and 30% identity with that of mannose-binding lectin from Japanese lamprey (Lethenteron japonicum), respectively. Both CRD1 and CRD2 of Fclectin have I I amino acids residues, which are relatively invariant in animals' C-type lectin CRDs. Five residues at Ca2+ binding site I are conserved in Fclectin. The potential Ca2+/carbohydrate-binding (site 2) motif QPD, E, NP (Gln-Pro-Asp, Glu, Asn-Pro) presented in the two CRDs of Fclectin may support its ability to bind galactose-type sugars. It could be deduced that Fclectin is a member of C-type lectin superfamily. Transcripts of Fclectin were found only in hemocytes by Northern blotting and RNA in situ hybridization. The variation of mRNA transcription level in hemocytes during artificial infection with bacteria and white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) was quantitated by capillary electrophoresis after RT-PCR. An exploration of mRNA expression variation after LPS stimulation was carried out in primarily cultured hemocytes in vitro. Expression profiles of Fclectin gene were greatly modified after bacteria, LPS or WSSV challenge. The above-stated data can provide us clues to understand the probable role of C-type lectin in innate immunity of shrimp and would be helpful to shrimp disease control. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
