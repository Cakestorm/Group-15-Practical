{"title": "Article 553", "body": "In this study, drug target was identified using KEGG database and network analysis through Cytoscape software. Designed series of novel benzimidazoles were taken along with reference standard Flibanserin for insilico modeling. The novel 4-(1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2-yl)-N-(substituted phenyl)-4-oxobutanamide (3a-j) analogs were synthesized and evaluated for their antidepressant activity. Reaction of 4-(1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2-yl)-4-oxobutanoic acid (1) with 4-(1H-benzo [d] imidazol-2-yl)-4-oxobutanoyl chloride (2) furnished novel 4-(1H-benzo [d] imidazol-2-yl)-N-(substituted phenyl)-4-oxobutanamide (3a-j). All the newly synthesized compounds were characterized by IR, H-1-NMR, and mass spectral analysis. The antidepressant activities of synthesized derivatives were compared with standard drug clomipramine at a dose level of 20mg/kg. Among the derivatives tested, most of the compounds were found to have potent activity against depression. The high level of activity was shown by the compounds 3d, 3e, 3i, and it significantly reduced the duration of immobility time at the dose level of 50mg/kg.\n", "text": "In this study, drug target was identified using KEGG database and network analysis through Cytoscape software.
