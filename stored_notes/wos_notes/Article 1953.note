{"title": "Article 1953", "body": "The use of nuclear energy to generate electric power is crucial to meet the high energy demand of a modern economy. In newly constructed nuclear power plants (NPPs), the trend among control systems is to replace the obsolete analog hard-wired systems with the contemporary digital and cyber-based systems. Therefore, cyberphysical security as well as dependability are critical issues in safety critical NPPs. In this paper, we present different levels/layers of protection to manage cyber/physical security. We also discuss the interrelationship between cyber and physical attacks. We adopt generalized stochastic Petri nets to quantitatively evaluate the intrusion probability. We then propose a new cyberframework and show that the proposed framework not only prevents cyberattacks but also conforms to cybersecurity regulations. We also propose a physical framework to prevent potential physical attacks. Finally, we discuss dependability through three metrics, i.e., reliability, maintainability, and availability. A case study is presented to demonstrate that the proposed cyberframework is highly dependable through analyzing steady-state probabilities.\n", "text": "The use of nuclear energy to generate electric power is crucial to meet the high energy demand of a modern economy.
