The goal of this study is to develop a unique artificial neural network (ANN) model that gives the best approach to predict the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of two different PTSTPPs integrated with thermal energy storage and fuel backup system; the first one is using thermic oil as primary heat transfer fluid in the solar field, while the other one is based on molten salt.
