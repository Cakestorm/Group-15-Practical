{"title": "Article 2693", "body": {"ops": [{"insert": "Background: Various insect species have been added to genomic databases over the years. Thus, researchers can easily obtain online genomic information on invertebrates and insects. However, many incorrectly annotated genes are included in these databases, which can prevent the correct interpretation of subsequent functional analyses. To address this problem, we used a combination of dry and wet bench processes to select functional genes from public databases. Results: Enolase is an important glycolytic enzyme in all organisms. We used a combination of dry and wet bench processes to identify functional enolases in the silkworm Bombyx mori (BmEno). First, we detected five annotated enolases from public databases using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) search, and then through cDNA cloning, Northern blotting, and RNA-seq analysis, we revealed three functional enolases in B. mori: BmEno1, BmEno2, and BmEnoC. BmEno1 contained a conserved key amino acid residue for metal binding and substrate binding in other species. However, BmEno2 and BmEnoC showed a change in this key amino acid. Phylogenetic analysis showed that BmEno2 and BmEnoC were distinct from BmEno1 and other enolases, and were distributed only in lepidopteran clusters. BmEno1 was expressed in all of the tissues used in our study. In contrast, BmEno2 was mainly expressed in the testis with some expression in the ovary and suboesophageal ganglion. BmEnoC was weakly expressed in the testis. Quantitative RT-PCR showed that the mRNA expression of BmEno2 and BmEnoC correlated with testis development; thus, BmEno2 and BmEnoC may be related to lepidopteran-specific spermiogenesis. Conclusions: We identified and characterized three functional enolases from public databases with a combination of dry and wet bench processes in the silkworm B. mori. In addition, we determined that BmEno2 and BmEnoC had species-specific functions. Our strategy could be helpful for the detection of minor genes and functional genes in non-model organisms from public databases.\n"}]}, "text": "Background: Various insect species have been added to genomic databases over the years.
