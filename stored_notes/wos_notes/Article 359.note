{"title": "Article 359", "body": {"ops": [{"insert": "Laminin (Lm) alpha 4 chain, a constituent of Lm-411 and Lm-421, is mainly localized to mesenchyme-derived tissues, and is suggested to have a role in formation and function of endothelium, transmigration of inflammatory cells through endothelium, and invasion of certain tumors. In this study, we evaluated the distribution of alpha 4 chain Lms in 33 conventional (clear cell) renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) (31 primary tumors, two metastases), two papillary RCCs, and two oncocytomas by immunohistochemistry. In all tumors, immunoreactivity for Lm alpha 4 chain was found in vasculature and stroma. Basement membranes were detected around tumor cell islets in 34/37 tumors. They showed immunoreactivity for Lm alpha 4 chain in 28/34 cases. Northern blotting, inhibition of protein secretion with monensin, and immunoprecipitation combined with Western blotting showed that Caki-2, ACHN, and Caki-1 renal carcinoma cell lines produce alpha 4 chain Lms. In cell adhesion assay, recombinant human Lm-411 did not promote adhesion of renal carcinoma cells but inhibited adhesion to fibronectin (Fn). In cell migration assay, the cells migrated more on Lm-411 than on Fn. The results suggest that alpha 4 chain Lms have a de- adhesive function and could thus play a role in detachment, migration and invasion of renal carcinoma cells in vivo.\n"}]}, "text": "Laminin (Lm) alpha 4 chain, a constituent of Lm-411 and Lm-421, is mainly localized to mesenchyme-derived tissues, and is suggested to have a role in formation and function of endothelium, transmigration of inflammatory cells through endothelium, and invasion of certain tumors.
