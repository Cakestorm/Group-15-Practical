{"title": "Article 2606", "body": "A novel driving method implemented with high frequency electromagnetic isolation is proposed in this paper. And the hardware designing schematic diagram and the software configuration method are presented. Then the corresponding operating principle is analyzed in detail based on digital control chip and analog circuits. The proposed driving method can be applied to real-time varying pulse width of the control signal and the duty-cycle ratio of this control pulse can be regulated in the range of 0-100 %. This novel driving method can achieve not only the advantages of high insulation and high common-mode suppression, but also the merits of low cost and fast dynamic response speed, and it is suitable for the isolation and amplification of high frequency switching control pulse signal. Finally, the experimental results show that the proposed driving method in this paper is effective.\n", "text": "A novel driving method implemented with high frequency electromagnetic isolation is proposed in this paper.
