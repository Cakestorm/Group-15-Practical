{"title": "Article 654", "body": {"ops": [{"insert": "Antimicrobial peptides are important components of the host innate immune responses by exerting broad-spectrum microbicidal activity against pathogenic microbes. The first mollusk big defensin (designated AiBD) cDNA was cloned from bay scallop Argopecten irradians by expressed sequence tag (EST) and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) techniques. The scallop AiBD consisted of 531 nucleotides with a canonical polyadenylation signal sequence AATAAA and a poly(A) tail, encoding a polypeptide of 122 amino acids. The high similarity of AiBD deduced amino acid sequence with big defensin from Tachypleus tridentatus and Branchiostoma belcheri tsingtaunese indicated that AiBD should be a member of big defensin family. The expression of AiBD in various tissues was measured by using Northern blotting analysis. mRNA transcripts of AiBD could be detected in haemocytes of unchallenged scallops. The temporal expression of AiBD in haemolymph after Vibrio anguilarum challenge was recorded by quantitative real time PCR. The relative expression level of AiBD in haemolymph was up-regulated evenly in the first 8 h, followed by a drastic increase, and increased 131.1-fold at 32 h post-injection. These results indicated that AiBD could be induced by bacterial challenge, and it should participate in the immune responses of A. irradians. Biological activity assay revealed that recombinant AiBD could inhibit the growth of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and also showed strong fungicidal activity towards the expression host. Recombinant expression of AiBD made it possible to further characterize its functions involved in immune responses, and also provided a potential therapeutic agent for disease control in aquaculture.
