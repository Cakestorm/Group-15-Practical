{"title": "Article 1902", "body": "In the last years, there is a greater interest in using computers in education, and in particular, in engineering education. Software programs have a great impact on studying many physical phenomena that otherwise could be described only using very complex mathematical algorithms. Furthermore, by computer simulation it can be studied the behavior of many engineering systems before its launching in production. However, the focus many times exclusively could be a handicap for the future engineers from a different perspective: lack of real measurement and future data manipulation and interpretation. At the same time, experimental stands could be often very expensive for many university laboratories. In this article, the author presents a methodology that could be a compromise between the use of software dedicated programs and of really electrical systems. The use of electronic simulators releases the university laboratory of expensive acquisitions and does not put a very large gap between practice and theoretical concepts. Based on the block system diagram of a real system, it is constructed the electronic simulator using basic Operational Amplifier structures' circuits. The result is an electronic system simulator.\n", "text": "In the last years, there is a greater interest in using computers in education, and in particular, in engineering education.
