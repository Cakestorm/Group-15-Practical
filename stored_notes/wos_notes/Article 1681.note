{"title": "Article 1681", "body": "Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), a disease characterized by inadequate neutrophil killing of microbial pathogens, affects 4 to 5 per million live births. For many decades following its description, CGD was a fatal disease in childhood. With the development of effective preventive therapies and the early recognition of infectious complications, 90% of children with CGD now survive into adulthood. The management of CGD in adults includes unique challenges and potential disease manifestations. In this article, the authors discuss the current approach to the management of CGD in both children and adults. This includes a focus on the importance of a comprehensive multidisciplinary approach in the care of CGD and its potential complications. In addition, a novel approach to improving education about CGD, and subsequently improving adherence to preventive therapies, is discussed.
