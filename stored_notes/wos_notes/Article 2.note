{"body": "Background: (-)-alpha-Bisabolol, also known as levomenol, is an unsaturated sesquiterpene alcohol that has mainly been used in pharmaceutical and cosmetic products due to its anti-inflammatory and skin-soothing properties. (-)-alpha-Bisabolol is currently manufactured mainly by steam-distillation of the essential oils extracted from the Brazilian candeia tree that is under threat because its natural habitat is constantly shrinking. Therefore, microbial production of (-)-alpha-bisabolol plays a key role in the development of its sustainable production from renewable feedstock. Results: Here, we created an Escherichia coli strain producing (-)-alpha-bisabolol at high titer and developed an in situ extraction method of (-)-alpha-bisabolol, using natural vegetable oils. We expressed a recently identified (-)-alpha-bisabolol synthase isolated from German chamomile (Matricaria recutita) (titer: 3 mg/L), converted the acetyl-CoA to mevalonate, using the biosynthetic mevalonate pathway (12.8 mg/L), and overexpressed farnesyl diphosphate synthase to efficiently supply the (-)-alpha-bisabolol precursor farnesyl diphosphate. Combinatorial expression of the exogenous mevalonate pathway and farnesyl diphosphate synthase enabled a dramatic increase in (-)-alpha-bisabolol production in the shake flask culture (80 mg/L) and 5 L bioreactor culture (342 mg/L) of engineered E. coli harboring (-)-alpha-bisabolol synthase. Fed-batch fermentation using a 50 L fermenter was conducted after optimizing culture conditions, resulting in efficient (-)-alpha-bisabolol production with a titer of 9.1 g/L. Moreover, a green, downstream extraction process using vegetable oils was developed for in situ extraction of (-)-alpha-bisabolol during fermentation and showed high yield recovery (>98%). Conclusions: The engineered E. coli strains and economically viable extraction process developed in this study will serve as promising platforms for further development of microbial production of (-)-alpha-bisabolol at large scale.\n", "embeddings": ["-1.444684", "0.2679553", "0.81909007", "-0.52549016", "2.3462853", "-0.2909752", "-0.34480265", "-0.63849163", "0.20523424", "0.8698313", "-0.004910356", "-1.7648895", "-0.7426735", "1.4763997", "-0.7675094", "0.37697858", "0.05662189", "0.39227155", "-0.42106193", "1.9751108", "-0.33615732", "-0.69568163", "-1.0141673", "1.6446468", "-1.3035882", "-0.95647395", "1.3341091", "1.1557083", "-0.33105132", "0.28741914", "0.001080229", "-0.3196985", "-0.051034987", "-0.6876017", "-0.70714325", "-0.07929374", "0.34725288", "0.27952668", "1.8726897", "0.49343145", "-1.1581643", "-0.50856745", "-0.6451492", "-1.0427046", "0.21801701", "-1.0281976", "1.089126", "-2.0105479", "1.9054776", "1.2585062", "0.8390852", "0.2870928", "0.28524634", "-1.5200446", "0.6645337", "-0.106631204", "0.48918617", "0.9620257", "-0.5708823", "0.4219216", "-0.030059747", "0.09654458", "0.58221215", "-0.5453786", "-1.1729496", "-0.78299934", "1.6703367", "2.386055", "-2.2270045", "1.3462883", "0.18296653", "-2.0580344", "-0.68583477", "1.2670482", "-1.9568214", "-0.28209475", "1.635762", "-0.23833859", "-2.2845578", "0.6999962", "0.21802497", "-1.9090892", "0.9424627", "-0.15973812", "-1.8736144", "0.55493623", "1.4761407", "1.5716021", "-1.243684", "-0.49505216", "0.95592594", "-0.29077074", "-1.2816781", "0.07142605", "1.7738751", "0.43714774", "-0.5325612", "0.20178908", "0.7666602", "0.90085244", "-0.32717207", "1.0583376", "-1.5876571", "-0.0730051", "-2.0504792", "1.0221688", "-0.48057985", "1.6518815", "-0.33949298", "-0.35774538", "-1.0120656", "-0.84807837", "-0.86527103", "0.44011024", "0.8005543", "-0.39950982", "0.3049303", "-0.7961262", "-0.5559097", "1.2253051", "0.5916522", "2.334339", "-0.24180402", "-0.1268889", "2.1910758", "1.6323475", "0.08998257", "0.7518216", "0.71787864", "0.26057288", "1.3501552", "0.95381343", "0.63709754", "-0.30056205", "0.06503783", "3.2715814", "-2.311293", "-1.0106461", "0.27573127", "0.48325804", "0.4326796", "-0.31026244", "-2.6088655", "0.51366717", "-0.089688", "0.79848385", "-1.4372845", "-0.6090359", "-0.59742796", "0.38799453", "0.04120957", "-2.5318768", "-0.8353212", "-1.3657086", "0.69175845", "1.1966758", "0.20098738", "0.5878676", "-0.38997912", "0.047063604", "0.41350025", "0.35563856", "-1.4487177", "0.53207225", "-0.023057243", "1.0458374", "-0.49978206", "-0.99693686", "-0.7044604", "-1.1886879", "-2.4689891", "0.84543175", "0.40193045", "0.29401416", "1.3892043", "-1.4950868", "-0.6306647", "0.024735099", "1.0593693", "-0.4254712", "-0.03911888", "-2.1405253", "-0.7110275", "0.4578284", "0.6948085", "1.3273135", "-0.8771309", "-0.75824", "3.0254295", "-0.7888577", "1.0344934", "-1.2057117", "0.11006716", "-1.0657856", "-0.7105169", "0.24343307", "1.3398099", "-0.97753805", "0.7199175", "-0.49471965"]}
