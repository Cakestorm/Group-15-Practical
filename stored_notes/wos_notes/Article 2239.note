{"title": "Article 2239", "body": "Sleep problems are common in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). This study aimed to examine the following: (1) predictors of sleep quality and (2) fluctuations in sleep quality in patients with SLE. Patients with SLE were recruited from three rheumatology centers in Japan. We collected demographic and clinical data and data on sleep quality as measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Medical Outcome Study Short Form-12, and the Lupus Patient Reported Outcome Tool (LupusPRO). Fluctuations in sleep quality were examined by administering the PSQI a second time after a 2-week interval. We used multiple linear regression analysis to predict sleep quality. Of 205 patients who completed the survey, 62.9% showed poor sleep quality. The largest fluctuation in sleep quality was for \"waking in the middle of the night or early morning.\" \"LupusPRO pain/vitality\" was a major predictor of poor sleep. The other significant predictors were mostly LupusPRO subscales and clinical variables and SF-12 subscales were mostly non-predictive. The majority of the participants had poor sleep quality. A lupus-specific QoL scale is important for understanding poor sleep quality in SLE patients. Symptom management appeared to play a key role in improving sleep quality.\n", "text": "Sleep problems are common in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
