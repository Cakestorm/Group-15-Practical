{"body": "Irinotecan is a natural alkaloid agent widely used in cancer therapy. High-mobility group protein B1 as a non-histone chromosomal protein plays a fundamental role in gene expression and inflammation. In this study, the effect of irinotecan on high-mobility group protein B1 and MMP9 content, gene expression, cell cycle, and cell growth in human breast cancer cells (MCF-7) was investigated. The cells were exposed to various concentrations of irinotecan and the viability determined by trypan blue exclusion and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazal-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays. High-mobility group B proteins were extracted from the control and drug-treated cells and analyzed by immunoblot. High-mobility group protein B1 and MMP9 messenger RNA expression was studied by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The results demonstrated reduction of cell viability upon increasing irinotecan concentration, up-regulated high-mobility group protein B1 gene expression, and down-regulated MMP9 mRNA. Although the content of high-mobility group protein B1 was decreased in chromatin extract upon drug action, no high-mobility group protein B1 release to extracellular space was detected by immunoblot analysis. Irinotecan decreased H3K9 acetylation and increased poly ADP-ribose polymerase fragmentation to 89 kDa and anion superoxide production suggesting induction of apoptosis in these cells. Propidium iodide staining of the cells 24 h after the drug treatment revealed arrest of the cells in S-phase. From the results, it is concluded that overexpression of high-mobility group protein B1 in the presence of irinotecan precedes breast cancer cells into apoptosis and in this response the binding of irinotecan to chromatin or high-mobility group protein B1 may condense/aggregate chromatin, preventing high-mobility group protein B1 release from chromatin.\n", "embeddings": ["0.6490012", "-1.1522489", "1.1602153", "-0.5586747", "1.3292207", "-0.82634246", "0.82634866", "2.0277147", "-1.8571352", "-0.19590709", "-0.89489347", "-0.34102154", "0.50481004", "0.45573318", "-1.0867172", "-2.2585285", "-0.42499903", "0.5514907", "-1.0514181", "-1.6933945", "0.25411502", "-0.04647834", "0.8882765", "0.608703", "0.808495", "0.22024818", "1.2426182", "0.7610948", "-0.56250757", "-1.125051", "1.4526587", "0.71585315", "0.44753203", "-2.4649208", "0.17842756", "-1.025092", "0.9730163", "1.0055115", "0.91859156", "1.8395934", "0.52314234", "0.572474", "-0.6769179", "-0.42474008", "0.2916375", "-0.57587284", "0.6025787", "-0.42244172", "-0.16117711", "-1.4249343", "0.4968634", "-0.7513915", "1.47599", "-1.3399622", "2.5805151", "1.7679555", "-0.5331223", "-0.46977866", "-0.37713927", "1.2813618", "0.28646982", "-0.32438517", "0.8810064", "-0.65810215", "-0.30331168", "-0.17157972", "2.064294", "1.3059565", "-0.9597697", "0.8516", "-1.2624458", "-0.0836121", "-0.85292816", "0.8135594", "1.1609377", "0.90917265", "0.0687757", "0.41236478", "-0.4184803", "0.07201606", "1.8285394", "-0.2070719", "-0.27989903", "0.9182858", "0.344709", "-0.32892632", "1.0589905", "0.022587733", "-1.1658568", "0.7706379", "0.66003436", "0.3640153", "-0.10228096", "-0.7262686", "0.62412614", "0.051994752", "-1.3255146", "-1.0465623", "-0.8429747", "0.84223986", "0.15185627", "1.5566266", "-0.3661401", "-1.7102555", "-2.1482377", "0.44793582", "0.7334526", "0.79502106", "1.0152853", "-0.33419213", "-0.18886022", "0.59213203", "-0.11891413", "0.0052369763", "0.5207026", "-2.6497622", "2.4563901", "0.32091218", "-0.61858153", "-0.64600396", "-1.5625132", "1.211515", "-0.84250486", "1.0061214", "1.1552516", "-0.15659778", "0.14181845", "-0.73855215", "-0.5609599", "-0.6522811", "-0.23563229", "-0.4232385", "-1.024016", "0.6047829", "0.12879366", "1.5486894", "0.45396727", "0.52096623", "0.28146908", "-1.5169283", "0.25929824", "-1.6106861", "1.3579661", "0.3235389", "0.92051965", "-0.7096231", "0.8105043", "-1.3245568", "0.5257199", "1.5216304", "1.4733481", "-2.2726307", "-1.3175056", "-0.358524", "0.26340267", "0.83627886", "1.7998437", "1.4431559", "0.30276522", "0.38131803", "-0.14603099", "1.4406449", "0.32432622", "0.7083941", "0.090941206", "0.300317", "0.59975404", "0.05848048", "0.3816192", "-0.036200788", "-1.3972747", "0.75072384", "-0.9254788", "-0.8843499", "-0.6697955", "0.029569875", "0.3378203", "1.4336979", "0.109865166", "2.0448136", "-0.40834564", "1.5796733", "0.55745673", "1.905849", "1.3009979", "1.3170815", "-1.121639", "1.5257256", "0.6540332", "0.80423343", "0.10924532", "-1.271265", "-0.43586543", "0.36448124", "-0.12382016", "-0.05324732", "0.72198653", "-0.7500869", "0.43620056", "-0.43841627"]}
