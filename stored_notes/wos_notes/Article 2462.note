{"title": "Article 2462", "body": "Aim: The dengue virus is responsible for a high worldwide incidence of infections, aggravated by late diagnosis, and often confused with other tropical diseases. Results/methodology: Oligonucleotide aptamers binding to the 5'-UTR from dengue virus selected after eight rounds by systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment technology were analyzed by dot-blot assay and in silico prediction of secondary structures, demonstrating the presence of stem-loops that may have the potential for interaction with the viral genome, which can lead to loss of their original conformation. Conclusion: This is the first description of RNA aptamers against functional RNA elements of the dengue virus genome with implications for disease control, which may have potential as tools in the future of antiviral therapies and for diagnostics.\n", "text": "Aim: The dengue virus is responsible for a high worldwide incidence of infections, aggravated by late diagnosis, and often confused with other tropical diseases.
