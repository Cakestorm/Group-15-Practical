Design: Immune and inflammation transcriptomic analysis with the use of the Nanostring nCounter GX Human Immunology V2 platform (579 human immune and inflammation-related genes and 15 housekeeping genes). Setting: Academic university and teaching hospital. Intervention(s): None. Patient(s): Stage III-IV endometriosis patients with infertility (n = 8) and fertile disease-free control women undergoing tubal ligation (n = 8). Menstrual stage was matched to secretory phase in all participants. Main Outcome Measure(s): Immune and inflammation transcriptomics quantification from ectopic endometriotic lesions and matched eutopic endometrium from patients. Endometria of fertile women served as control subjects. Result(s): Our results displayed endometriotic lesions as molecularly distinct entities compared with eutopic endometrium and endometrium of control samples; 396 out of 579 screened immune and inflammation-related genes were significantly different in ectopic tissues compared with control endometrium. Most importantly, eutopic endometrium of the patients displayed a unique molecular profile compared with the control endometrium (91/579 genes were significantly different), particularly of genes involved in regulation of cell apoptosis and decidualization. Conclusion(s): We characterize differential expression of immune-inflammation genes in endometriosis patients, and show molecular distinction of eutopic endometrium of patients compared with control fertile women.
