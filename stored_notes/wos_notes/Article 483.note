{"body": "Background: High serum basal tryptase (sBT) levels have been identified as a risk factor for both venom-and food-induced severe allergic reactions. The aim of this study was to compare sBT levels in children with different severity of actual drug hypersensitivity reactions (DHRs) with those of age-and sex-matched controls without any history of DHRs. Method: Patients between 0 and 18 years of age with a history of immediate-type DHRs manifested in 0-6 h after the culprit drug intake were included. Following ENDA (European Network for Drug Allergy) inquiries, patients were evaluated with skin and/or provocation tests to define the actual drug-hypersensitive patients. Serum BT levels were determined for both patients and controls. Results: Of 345 children, 106 patients (30.7%) [(58.5% male), median age (interquartile range) 8.0 years (4.2-12.2)] were diagnosed as drug hypersensitive. Ninety-eight controls were also included. The sBT levels of drug-hypersensitive patients with and without anaphylaxis and the control group were similar [2.6 (2.0-3.6) lg/l vs. 2.8 (1.6-4.3) lg/l vs. 2.6 (1.8-3.6) lg/l, respectively, (p >0.05)]. The sBT levels of the patients with sole cutaneous symptoms 2.8 (1.6-4.3) lg/l, mild anaphylaxis 3.0 (1.9-4.9) lg/l, and moderate-to-severe anaphylaxis 2.6 (2.0-3.6) lg/l were also comparable (p >0.05). The onset of DHRs [those occurring in 1 h (n = 87) or in 1-6 h (n = 19) after the drug intake], positive results with skin tests with the culprit drug, or the classification of the patients according to different age groups [(0-2 years), (2-6 years), (6-12 years), (12-18 years)] did not correlate with sBT levels. Conclusion: The sBT levels in children with actual drug hypersensitivity would not be a risk factor for severe systemic reactions on the contrary to children with allergic reactions to food or insect venom.\n", "embeddings": ["-0.012495342", "-2.0206997", "2.808038", "-2.201107", "0.96615756", "-0.940372", "0.89701277", "0.4259871", "-1.1845869", "0.88408715", "0.81861323", "0.5736087", "0.36848783", "-0.016598903", "-0.161179", "1.725889", "-0.06419241", "-0.3944526", "-0.44977465", "-2.9421358", "-0.08177899", "-0.41737553", "0.7801472", "1.2482479", "0.26296946", "1.7323456", "0.83545494", "-1.0720804", "-2.2378137", "-0.45360613", "0.53063333", "0.37951994", "0.7665264", "-0.88965005", "1.7919037", "0.8265018", "-0.18745427", "-0.46137387", "-0.16712496", "-0.64595264", "-0.5738919", "0.19001684", "-1.1132052", "-0.18063883", "0.0013497216", "-1.3394446", "1.2367641", "0.40436453", "-1.4649962", "-0.37215307", "1.2820663", "-0.7320774", "-0.3311247", "0.74225986", "0.092298865", "1.213022", "0.19149193", "0.013962535", "-0.678334", "-0.2924736", "-0.14049728", "-0.15267232", "-1.3578589", "-0.72866905", "-1.4011836", "0.796505", "-0.2597391", "2.3612878", "0.25791568", "0.9635133", "0.90308416", "0.6074245", "1.4999584", "0.7167282", "0.5114781", "-0.03733511", "-0.78330606", "1.0769614", "-0.8949068", "0.26227275", "-0.7019565", "0.3798527", "-0.22255687", "2.0038033", "-1.6920813", "-1.4479718", "-0.35144666", "1.6174048", "0.9486775", "1.2853247", "1.1868815", "1.0087792", "-1.4599866", "-0.6717007", "-1.2081466", "-0.31571686", "-0.56294906", "-0.229165", "0.7842296", "-0.5655728", "-0.6578827", "2.257002", "-0.49148965", "-0.47799703", "-1.3310121", "-2.9037447", "0.15748167", "1.9965779", "-0.98862475", "-2.108234", "0.740232", "-2.2239418", "-0.61308765", "0.87282467", "1.7160759", "-0.96419245", "0.26173425", "-0.73713624", "-1.1474028", "-2.4201539", "1.2679924", "1.1985531", "0.0077495174", "-0.4638003", "-0.79473823", "-1.0260743", "0.5130311", "-0.86134785", "1.0461909", "-0.7069943", "-0.73122835", "-0.998381", "0.13200377", "-1.5445536", "-1.3868759", "0.5535683", "-0.41054937", "1.8152593", "-0.12917526", "-0.21532817", "0.5957171", "-0.27030674", "0.09932449", "0.025126232", "-0.49791667", "-1.3775061", "1.0101508", "0.64591306", "0.4172016", "3.0300095", "-1.1740016", "0.9305652", "-0.06599244", "0.25484878", "0.1538447", "2.0235534", "-0.5854878", "0.19727917", "-0.82380915", "0.14980501", "0.11989444", "1.3725133", "-0.63068306", "-0.20785928", "-0.27892813", "0.49053705", "1.49342", "-0.5014303", "0.48985812", "0.520251", "-0.47244248", "-0.51881194", "-0.35901898", "-0.29917476", "0.04470273", "0.8108726", "-1.148118", "-0.31928158", "1.715285", "0.13019755", "0.10583854", "0.8628426", "0.84873563", "0.3401472", "0.4385372", "0.7527815", "-1.087804", "1.5208348", "-0.25724912", "-0.35764033", "0.5399879", "-2.0174823", "-0.9419515", "0.9103261", "1.2935674", "-0.2808826", "1.5031966", "0.28260016", "1.6279167", "0.9806645"]}
