In the proposed active RC filter, the noise figure and bandwidth are improved through adopting the proposed sub-1 Omega Z(out) source follower, which replaces the conventional operational amplifier-based unity gain buffer and through simply changing its location in the filter. Applying the proposed scheme to the conventional Sallen-Key filter also improves the stopband rejection performance.

The proposed biquad filter consumes 14 mA from a 1.8 V supply and the chip occupies 1000x500 mu m(2).\n"}]}, "text": "This paper reports a source follower-based active RC filter topology for RF front-ends in wideband systems.
