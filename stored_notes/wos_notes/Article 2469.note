{"body": "Recently, specific attention has been paid to aptamers, short DNA or RNA, as a tool for cancer diagnosis and therapy. In the present study MCS nanogels were prepared by Myristate: Chitosan at 1: 9 ratio and were characterized by several techniques. A selected ssDNA aptamer (Apt) capable of detecting LNCaP cells was linked to Myristilated Chitosan nanogels (Apt-MCS) by glutaraldehyde and loaded with Doxorubicin (DOX) to be used in targeted drug delivery against the Prostate cancer cells. LNCaP and PC-3 cells were treated with Apt-MCS-DOX complex and the binding efficiency was estimated by flow cytometry. The binding affinity of the selected aptamers was above 70% compared to the initial library. The loading capacity of the nanogel was as high as 97% and up to 40% of DOX were released from MCS within 15 days. Cytotoxicity of nanodrug on LNCaP cells was determined by MTT assay. Apt-MCS- DOX was specifically binded to LNCaP cells whereas it didn't show any specificity to PC-3 cells as a negative control. Both MCS-DOX and Apt-MCS-DOX showed a lethal effect on LNCaP cells. Our results can lead to an aptamer based simple and applicable technique for early diagnosis and treatment of cancerous cells.\n", "embeddings": ["-1.2369596", "0.33516282", "1.2911758", "1.0195068", "0.7854695", "-0.1804052", "-0.58806634", "1.6866189", "-1.4024986", "0.9459388", "-1.1750149", "-0.38186562", "-0.25234354", "0.3287045", "-0.778616", "-0.06915705", "-0.1230334", "-0.60504985", "0.51234823", "-0.8620097", "0.19427408", "-1.0984383", "1.7220687", "-0.24329472", "1.1032284", "-0.24519841", "-0.29643947", "1.5153626", "0.21108352", "-0.22668107", "1.2695396", "0.29005903", "0.6661387", "1.5499561", "1.2300909", "0.23318064", "0.3790207", "-0.50514436", "-0.53303355", "1.3115009", "0.65178293", "0.15360036", "0.114506364", "-0.47244698", "1.3219943", "-0.69890046", "0.14018169", "-2.2343185", "0.8816953", "0.21874171", "-0.6556574", "0.47004208", "0.52689666", "-0.90014297", "-0.45939943", "0.34984174", "-1.3252211", "-0.007035856", "-0.20281899", "-1.5026197", "-0.8236575", "1.6180726", "1.0621232", "-0.502247", "-0.60765046", "0.53703386", "0.99436015", "2.1084678", "-0.8768623", "1.3660591", "-0.44848377", "-1.319437", "0.3925394", "1.1910973", "-1.4498359", "0.5193886", "0.87690574", "-1.2423013", "0.38416436", "-0.99176145", "1.8420478", "-0.34528893", "-1.2863147", "0.11545116", "-2.2270715", "-0.6651673", "0.7291018", "-0.02901481", "-0.078703985", "0.054739974", "1.2493418", "-0.5427926", "0.4216242", "-1.4987801", "0.051952787", "-0.1157323", "0.73809695", "0.1455619", "-0.68960714", "1.680965", "0.025532696", "-0.3483312", "-1.2948761", "-0.61429405", "0.6744324", "-2.7145529", "0.14630488", "1.0898703", "-0.39062455", "0.619479", "-0.9340736", "-1.1557033", "0.5215854", "0.24324866", "1.2292899", "-0.87754685", "-0.8510691", "-1.108549", "-0.15542772", "-1.129124", "-1.251205", "-0.114595234", "-1.3039972", "0.9620997", "1.4303964", "0.30505043", "-0.4005748", "-0.45833123", "-0.5627633", "-0.96894056", "0.038995177", "0.0926806", "1.0675657", "0.14951813", "-1.1701533", "-0.70496666", "-0.81122464", "0.93338656", "0.547799", "-1.5914165", "-0.95924175", "-0.069198556", "-0.53573644", "-0.35823125", "0.14237273", "-0.38199162", "0.5753399", "0.32701188", "-0.28733793", "1.3798509", "0.0016886194", "-0.5267987", "-1.4917521", "0.23104124", "0.040262", "0.8071651", "0.33502987", "1.6621569", "1.0465785", "0.20981255", "0.50347567", "0.17434126", "-0.84910834", "0.06405893", "-0.7509083", "-0.64202404", "-0.27128088", "-1.1435344", "-0.8905202", "1.4078528", "-0.63830143", "0.3130449", "-0.31381407", "-1.1365336", "1.8596418", "0.4343102", "0.9572423", "-0.30484477", "1.0681791", "0.468539", "0.96219814", "0.24276981", "0.58527374", "0.84076047", "0.8196841", "0.50211316", "-1.0516437", "-1.5406643", "0.41148198", "0.90312314", "0.73349035", "-0.29441053", "0.8828989", "1.1940786", "-0.14051577", "1.4905553", "1.0797752", "-0.29017144", "-0.16767892", "-0.47950172"]}
