{"title": "Article 1214", "body": "In digitally controlled circuits for power electronic circuits, sampling data are important because the digital control circuit is operated on the basis of these data. If the sampled values have been affected by switching noise from the power circuit, the control stability of the circuit would be disturbed. This paper proposes a noiseless sampling method that can sample a value without being affected by the switching noise. The synchronous sampling method may be affected by the switching noise depending on the duty ratio of the circuit. The noiseless sampling method does not obtain data immediately after turn-on and turn-off switching. The control circuit can avoid the switching noise by using noiseless sampling, which leads to a disturbance in the control circuit and enhances the robustness of the circuit when applying the multisampling method. Experimental results are presented to verify that the current control of the proposed sampling method is not disturbed by the switching noise even in the absence of a noise filter.\n", "text": "In digitally controlled circuits for power electronic circuits, sampling data are important because the digital control circuit is operated on the basis of these data.
