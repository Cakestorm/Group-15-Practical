{"body": "The cement production process is energy intensive both in terms of the thermal energy (firing the kiln, drying and De carbonation) and electrical energy for driving the numerous drives within the process line. The average specific power consumption of the case study plant was 111kWh/ton of cement with an average peak demand of 9.7MW. The high cost of electric power at 0.14USD/kWh results in very high cost of production that significantly lowers the company's profit margin and limits its competitive advantage. The generation of electrical power from waste heat recovery would reduce the electricity power bill through partially substituting the power procured from the national grid. This research evaluated the potential that the plant has for generating electrical power from the hot waste gases vented into the atmosphere and it was found that the plant has the potential to generate 3.4MWh of electrical power. This results to a net potential to generate 2.89MWh of electrical power after factoring in the auxiliary power consumption by Waste heat recovery plant system at 15%. This ultimately gave a reduction of 33% in the electricity power bill of the case study plant. The paper recommends the installation of a steam rankine cycle for the power generating plant. In this work the authors designed the steam boilers for the waste heat recovery plant for conversion of thermal energy to electrical energy, selected a commercial steam turbine and evaluated its economic feasibility and established that the designed plant would have a simple payback period of 2.7years.\n", "embeddings": ["-0.89644396", "-0.9572899", "-0.03319243", "1.1026131", "1.0471631", "-0.38685662", "-0.5038312", "0.8353113", "-0.197596", "1.1111014", "-1.4534053", "1.8686259", "-1.6304464", "0.23016705", "-0.13789254", "0.36562914", "0.64349115", "-0.8791516", "-1.2508677", "-1.0241982", "-0.59668064", "-2.1457312", "0.3112656", "0.4522436", "0.8022824", "-0.7555458", "1.0290715", "0.49115595", "-1.2782389", "0.2508982", "1.7730404", "1.1543415", "-0.45936006", "1.0461034", "-0.8481193", "-0.8287251", "-0.6794341", "-1.3880184", "-0.57677215", "-0.59165823", "-0.25367057", "-0.58712137", "-0.3848931", "-1.9710974", "-1.6560467", "-0.75902766", "0.5030273", "0.9649891", "0.11389852", "0.52281237", "0.124087684", "-0.40250924", "1.5881445", "-1.1875936", "-0.08567431", "1.2543588", "1.1596249", "-0.44494802", "0.28495586", "1.8032925", "-0.058017857", "0.9485001", "0.934573", "-0.5999214", "0.19818106", "-1.1400584", "0.3964852", "1.5724025", "-0.6619613", "0.10622625", "0.8523124", "-1.4217315", "0.26092407", "0.18079971", "-0.43947628", "0.5906625", "1.1273359", "-1.3962377", "0.02358604", "-0.560577", "0.5116877", "-0.9997063", "-0.30478647", "1.4221246", "-1.2710037", "-0.59579164", "2.4292917", "0.3970625", "-0.46273303", "1.1536075", "2.0622265", "-0.19039054", "0.95535755", "-0.52163476", "1.2010645", "1.5030307", "-0.33457512", "0.0041684043", "0.69583434", "1.0178415", "-0.26427794", "1.7190692", "-0.29557142", "0.531066", "0.026965065", "2.043554", "-0.7132098", "1.2062397", "-0.08875617", "-0.14482237", "-1.403719", "1.0793332", "-0.3324995", "-0.4038645", "0.7246972", "-1.4588624", "-0.5566772", "0.6918722", "0.59211516", "1.05241", "-0.028250294", "1.1946617", "-0.8207916", "-0.44940212", "0.59648037", "0.22049233", "0.715246", "-0.42001054", "0.026438404", "-0.98197395", "1.2921073", "-1.3483258", "0.65502167", "0.99810696", "-0.07792675", "1.8862383", "-0.6490787", "1.0854292", "-1.2173645", "0.41748643", "-0.4437366", "-0.52098304", "-0.4210015", "-0.7901946", "-0.3960421", "1.4608327", "-1.1405772", "-0.6558086", "1.0630836", "-0.550822", "-0.06798368", "-0.7439573", "0.26808226", "-0.80362177", "1.1681273", "-0.70622", "-0.6955944", "-0.6853233", "0.66700494", "0.73880064", "-0.20034893", "0.25748444", "-0.3872835", "-0.15110691", "-1.277402", "1.257424", "0.21836323", "0.87943184", "-3.0673316", "-0.6422399", "-1.092267", "-1.2517813", "1.3073496", "-1.4889888", "0.25825655", "1.0696931", "-0.87872314", "0.1925163", "2.922003", "-1.3026057", "0.9360535", "-1.0103778", "0.16514578", "-1.6931782", "0.53000337", "0.57679176", "0.5961146", "0.16353936", "-0.37320018", "-1.4924093", "1.5763882", "-1.2237159", "-0.4128859", "-1.8851914", "-0.18450713", "2.194422", "0.91015434", "0.6762654", "-0.13178392", "-0.12520789"]}
