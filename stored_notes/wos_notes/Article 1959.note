{"title": "Article 1959", "body": {"ops": [{"insert": "The cement production process is energy intensive both in terms of the thermal energy (firing the kiln, drying and De carbonation) and electrical energy for driving the numerous drives within the process line. The average specific power consumption of the case study plant was 111kWh/ton of cement with an average peak demand of 9.7MW. The high cost of electric power at 0.14USD/kWh results in very high cost of production that significantly lowers the company's profit margin and limits its competitive advantage. The generation of electrical power from waste heat recovery would reduce the electricity power bill through partially substituting the power procured from the national grid. This research evaluated the potential that the plant has for generating electrical power from the hot waste gases vented into the atmosphere and it was found that the plant has the potential to generate 3.4MWh of electrical power. This results to a net potential to generate 2.89MWh of electrical power after factoring in the auxiliary power consumption by Waste heat recovery plant system at 15%.
