{"title": "Article 2972", "body": "Mushroom production is one of the biggest solid state fermentation industries in the world. The success in mushroom planting depends on how the control temperature, humidity and CO2 parameters. This paper presents a novel method for modeling an environment of mushrooms growth to comparing the performance of two controlling methods (fuzzy logic and digital (ON/OFF) control) for controlling mentioned parameters on production rate. The Controllers and other equipment were developed to data collection and analysis of these parameters was performed by using Simulink part of MATLAB software. Precise control of the parameters involved in the growth of mushrooms caused to improve product quality and reduced energy consumption. The results of tests and mean value obtained on two different methods showed that the fuzzy controlling with having least standard deviation, variance and error, is better than digital controlling. Fuzzy controlling system had the lowest fluctuation and lowest band pass. According to gradient of graph, maximum and minimum of results, can conclude that the fuzzy controlling has shown better response in controlling the process. Based on the number of actuators mode changing on both systems, it can be understood that in digital control system, downtime, and depreciation and energy consumption would be higher than the fuzzy control system.
