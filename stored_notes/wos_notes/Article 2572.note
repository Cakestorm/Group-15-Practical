{"title": "Article 2572", "body": "As environmental issues become more prominent, electric vehicles (EV) have attracted an increasing amount of attention. However, the continuous cruising distance of an EV is limited to approximately 160 km, which is insufficient for everyday use. Battery capacity is the limiting factor in long-distance EV travel, because the vehicles need to stop at EV recharging stations multiple times. In Japan, there are more than 2,000 EV charge stations, but there are, at most, two rapid chargers. When multiple users converge at the station, a queuing (or waiting) condition is created, which may lead to a call-loss condition. In other words, an appropriate number of chargers must be installed at each station when planning the EV infrastructure. Therefore, the number of vehicles entering the station must be estimated. In this study, a mathematical model based on the supporting infrastructure for widespread EV use is proposed to estimate the number of vehicles arriving at each charge station.\n", "text": "As environmental issues become more prominent, electric vehicles (EV) have attracted an increasing amount of attention.
