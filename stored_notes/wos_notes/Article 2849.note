{"title": "Article 2849", "body": "This descriptive study evaluates how dance movement psychotherapy (DMP) works in patients with fibromyalgia, analysing the psychotherapeutic process. As a second objective, we considered the effects of DMP on pain, stiffness, fatigue, anxiety, depression and lifestyle changes. The study includes 16 patients with a diagnosis of primitive fibromyalgia who were referred to individual DMP for psychological distress related to pain. Self-assessment questionnaires were administered before and after the intervention, and the data were analysed using a simple regression model and Student's test. Despite limitations, the study highlights changes in many areas of the relationship with Self and with Others. Some of the symptoms of fibromyalgia seem to have decreased, but the results were not statistically significant. The patients used the movement as a means of expression despite pain or other disabling symptoms. A low drop-out rate suggests that this approach could be useful when it is difficult to develop a therapeutic alliance.\n", "text": "This descriptive study evaluates how dance movement psychotherapy (DMP) works in patients with fibromyalgia, analysing the psychotherapeutic process.
