{"body": "Learning objectives: After participating in this activity, learners should be better able to: Evaluate the evolution of social cognitive abilities as a developmental process Assess the evidence regarding social cognition difficulties in youth at clinical high risk for psychosis Individuals at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis exhibit a broad range of difficulties, including impaired social cognition, which may represent a target for early identification and intervention. Several studies have examined various domains of social cognition in CHR individuals. Most focus on adolescent and young adult populations, but given the accumulating evidence that impairment exists before the onset of psychotic disorders, it is critically important to begin to look for these risk markers in younger children. The present article reviews 25 studies on CHR that examine any of the following four domains of social cognition: emotion processing, theory of mind, social perception, or attribution bias. Eligible studies were identified through a comprehensive literature search, conducted using electronic databases, including PubMed/MEDLINE and PsycINFO, and combinations of key social-cognition and CHR search terms. Despite some mixed results, the existing literature establishes that CHR individuals display social-cognitive impairment, though it remains unclear as to how and when that impairment develops. Thus, by using the literature on social cognition in typically developing children as a model and reference, and by looking at the evolution of social-cognitive abilities as a developmental process, our review presents a valuable new perspective that indicates the necessity of further investigation in younger, at-risk populations. Implications for treatment and future research are discussed.\n", "embeddings": ["0.38210008", "0.29702976", "0.08030812", "-0.67986786", "-0.26350114", "-1.1137679", "1.2427989", "0.98570865", "-1.5226016", "-0.18905798", "0.8575574", "0.15135494", "0.47838223", "-0.014092537", "-1.5181526", "-0.19706827", "0.79040563", "0.23578899", "-1.4702554", "-1.4268849", "-0.44722766", "-1.3031793", "0.97540987", "-0.53163064", "0.5592623", "0.56509703", "0.7827712", "-1.9228798", "0.54087883", "-1.5904286", "-0.8508093", "1.5863413", "-0.21021605", "1.1905502", "1.0581841", "-1.3339629", "-0.11203097", "-0.68759495", "0.7078725", "-1.2545379", "-1.1216285", "-0.6720914", "-0.0037390203", "-0.13925813", "1.0293326", "-0.6320549", "-1.8736897", "-0.16577044", "1.0036923", "1.2778779", "0.53157234", "0.50905", "-0.50603056", "1.1944225", "0.3099098", "0.76182836", "0.3260063", "0.0018748747", "0.62643296", "-1.064677", "-0.880789", "0.19134645", "-0.33868003", "0.20336336", "-0.81126493", "2.1697826", "0.58436394", "1.6901163", "-0.95513994", "1.124616", "1.0182703", "0.2705706", "1.1056421", "1.9350663", "0.9028682", "-0.028660687", "0.060653772", "-1.6876181", "-1.3151999", "-0.35943604", "-1.1314198", "0.08262761", "0.6360941", "1.4575154", "0.3477168", "0.4828268", "0.1563593", "-2.2047424", "0.29036435", "0.17664394", "0.037334744", "1.1005312", "0.40149224", "1.282769", "0.9774917", "0.043383483", "-0.71049", "-0.24958846", "-0.15809526", "-1.3873519", "-0.62879676", "0.3565767", "-0.45820853", "1.1654857", "0.84936345", "-1.929096", "1.3197528", "0.7315527", "-0.34628195", "-1.7283711", "-0.6372934", "0.57178545", "-0.18711309", "0.18585853", "1.1638408", "-0.6195716", "1.3082957", "-0.9987728", "0.46391302", "-0.1716568", "0.08527472", "0.57149297", "-0.25377733", "-1.5837432", "-0.40526527", "-0.7416445", "0.06260976", "0.95607954", "-0.018374179", "0.09215703", "-0.2262549", "1.1772733", "-0.4005889", "0.32878348", "0.7542216", "-0.45085764", "-0.20142877", "0.2591761", "0.6596199", "1.2354057", "0.44880766", "0.8920593", "-1.3909678", "0.21480528", "1.344463", "1.052181", "-0.9521157", "-1.4485999", "2.1825788", "-0.25564215", "0.104699105", "-0.9986745", "-0.8200793", "0.16376063", "-2.523418", "1.9695789", "-0.058289405", "1.5751258", "0.43522206", "0.20366128", "1.1830119", "-0.4896838", "0.0050890516", "-0.7022261", "1.0473155", "-0.053159215", "-0.014279922", "-2.4742107", "1.4600765", "0.36019793", "-0.8993351", "-1.0093572", "0.7634507", "-0.17033146", "0.103449434", "-0.105878405", "-1.3419682", "-1.027301", "-0.7387664", "-0.38775334", "-0.00012175586", "1.5793041", "0.4726811", "-1.1334603", "-0.6500679", "0.40921354", "1.1378931", "-1.5487099", "1.9827003", "-0.018815098", "-0.46391505", "-0.97814846", "-0.019132337", "-0.55464", "0.6902564", "1.8805132", "-0.43455395", "-0.101184346", "-0.8215451", "-1.3065797"]}
