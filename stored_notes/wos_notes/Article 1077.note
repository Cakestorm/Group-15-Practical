{"body": "Glycoprotein nonmetastatic melanoma protein B is a type 1 transmembrane protein that has been recently found to play a role in cancer cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and invasion. Due to its potential responsibility in cancer aggressiveness, the main objective of this work was to investigate its expression in bladder cancer and the biological functions in bladder cancer cells. Using immunohistochemistry, western blot, and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, we analyzed the expression of glycoprotein nonmetastatic melanoma protein B in bladder cancer tissues and bladder cancer cell lines. The effects of glycoprotein nonmetastatic melanoma protein B on proliferation, migration, and invasion were tested after knocking down the glycoprotein nonmetastatic melanoma protein B in bladder cancer cells with small interfering RNAs by CCK-8, Transwell, and Matrigel assays. Our results showed that glycoprotein nonmetastatic melanoma protein B protein was highly expressed in the bladder cancer tissues and cell lines. Downregulating glycoprotein nonmetastatic melanoma protein B could suppress the proliferation, migration, and invasion in bladder cancer cells. Glycoprotein nonmetastatic melanoma protein B expression was related to the poor differentiation and recurrence by immunohistochemistry analysis. The survival analysis also showed that glycoprotein nonmetastatic melanoma protein B was related to the patient prognosis. In conclusion, Glycoprotein nonmetastatic melanoma protein B protein was highly expressed in the bladder cancer, which was related to the poor prognosis in bladder cancer patients. Glycoprotein nonmetastatic melanoma protein B promoted the proliferation, migration, and invasion in bladder cancer cells.\n", "embeddings": ["-0.7653673", "-0.1662461", "0.25166887", "-0.9352193", "0.63134414", "-0.5181689", "0.6107771", "2.0268972", "-1.1615794", "-0.35300234", "-0.21860616", "-0.26312688", "-0.22297895", "-0.15182519", "-0.75628453", "0.22211738", "-0.65455806", "-0.0037464935", "0.23609138", "-2.3938563", "-0.3760495", "-0.78823185", "-0.6791794", "0.4737224", "-1.9951917", "0.21168555", "0.9857209", "0.4027751", "-0.38145834", "0.4254403", "1.4911332", "-0.96997935", "1.0501714", "-0.524507", "0.63801503", "0.3240518", "-0.51761043", "-1.5256022", "0.2055089", "-1.1499027", "-0.09956112", "-0.97735256", "-0.7382174", "-0.36951724", "0.83752966", "-0.122275926", "0.4874387", "0.5884374", "1.2772082", "0.077745564", "-0.29314557", "0.06567635", "-0.79452467", "-0.91744494", "1.3431162", "0.152702", "-1.3158927", "-0.32732227", "-1.12995", "1.1446103", "1.0432355", "0.85334986", "-0.25399557", "-0.70981336", "-0.09712897", "-0.11515081", "0.7624686", "0.7572372", "0.45415613", "0.5892148", "-0.15633984", "0.54123884", "2.218143", "0.31131396", "0.98538", "0.39424235", "0.23709153", "-0.18323663", "-0.84117895", "0.49994543", "0.60948396", "-0.37584418", "0.073753014", "0.5910901", "-0.12522192", "-1.0230054", "1.0884964", "-0.15285231", "-0.68061835", "-0.8011324", "1.2901273", "0.43748426", "1.9951136", "0.40147617", "1.1026363", "0.21424928", "-0.056845907", "0.4849301", "-0.24200305", "-0.88318545", "0.81027716", "0.6764493", "-0.06756445", "-0.04269916", "0.15118717", "-1.7374958", "0.5570119", "0.13945152", "0.26135322", "0.18317248", "-1.2009763", "-1.1128318", "-1.5673783", "-0.15553567", "-0.10808152", "-1.4430197", "1.286226", "-0.15191525", "-1.1941519", "-0.491449", "-0.7420423", "0.21628053", "-0.15664145", "-0.09364422", "0.39098734", "-0.9936116", "-1.05934", "-0.40727258", "-0.7914158", "-0.3948177", "2.2338293", "-0.87694687", "0.76079625", "0.080307074", "-0.13448226", "1.4032971", "0.2557159", "0.569243", "-0.523329", "-0.5659551", "-0.9273574", "0.4399442", "-0.119940236", "-0.26517034", "-0.24993274", "0.57221633", "-0.9697882", "-0.43202052", "0.49655074", "1.083279", "1.2909914", "-0.93910456", "-0.68309456", "-0.5977849", "-0.042746987", "0.67275965", "1.5517839", "2.5201094", "-0.521629", "-0.04077794", "0.08443349", "0.4895726", "0.9459401", "0.4152153", "-0.36648703", "0.014063694", "1.1269293", "1.0250045", "-1.1870688", "0.636933", "-0.013944305", "0.2591063", "0.30216068", "-0.06122012", "0.5375296", "-0.66836077", "0.071216464", "0.6430269", "-1.3140286", "0.26745442", "0.77715194", "-0.8460925", "2.2818644", "0.061104488", "-1.5802402", "-0.39402407", "-1.0462787", "0.7015021", "1.8856806", "-0.93269414", "0.50475687", "-0.15983298", "-0.2227633", "-1.1430763", "-0.42458293", "0.2102638", "0.66623235", "-0.16644976", "-0.8193169", "0.43884325"]}
