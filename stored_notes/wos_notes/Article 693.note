{"title": "Article 693", "body": "Background We have reported that increased fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), a measure of TH2-driven airway inflammation, and blood eosinophil count, a marker of systemic eosinophil inflammation, correlated with asthma attacks in a population-based study. Objective To investigate the relation between simultaneously elevated FeNO and serum eosinophil cationic protein (S-ECP) levels and asthma events among asthmatics. Methods Measurements of FeNO (elevated = 25 ppb) and S-ECP (elevated = 20 ng/mL) were performed in 339 adult asthmatics. Asthma events (attacks and symptoms) were selfreported. Results Simultaneously normal S-ECP and FeNO levels were found in 48% of the subjects. Subjects with simultaneously elevated S-ECP and FeNO (13% of the population) had a higher prevalence of asthma attacks in the preceding 3 months than subjects with normal S-ECP and FeNO (51% vs. 25%, P = 0.001). This was not found for subjects with singly elevated S-ECP (P = 0.14) or FeNO (P = 0.34) levels. Elevated S-ECP and FeNO levels were independently associated with asthma attacks in the preceding 3 months after adjusting for potential confounders (OR (95% CI) 4.2 (2.0-8.8). Conclusions Simultaneously elevated FeNO and S-ECP levels were related to a higher likelihood of asthma attacks in the preceding 3 months. This indicates that there is a value in measuring both FeNO and systemic eosinophilic inflammation in patients with asthma to identify individuals at high risk of exacerbations. Clinical relevance FeNO and S-ECP are markers for inflammation in asthma, but are dependent on different inflammatory pathways and weakly correlated. Simultaneous measurements of both offer better risk characterization of adult asthmatics.\n", "text": "Background We have reported that increased fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), a measure of TH2-driven airway inflammation, and blood eosinophil count, a marker of systemic eosinophil inflammation, correlated with asthma attacks in a population-based study.
