{"body": "Background We have reported that increased fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), a measure of TH2-driven airway inflammation, and blood eosinophil count, a marker of systemic eosinophil inflammation, correlated with asthma attacks in a population-based study. Objective To investigate the relation between simultaneously elevated FeNO and serum eosinophil cationic protein (S-ECP) levels and asthma events among asthmatics. Methods Measurements of FeNO (elevated = 25 ppb) and S-ECP (elevated = 20 ng/mL) were performed in 339 adult asthmatics. Asthma events (attacks and symptoms) were selfreported. Results Simultaneously normal S-ECP and FeNO levels were found in 48% of the subjects. Subjects with simultaneously elevated S-ECP and FeNO (13% of the population) had a higher prevalence of asthma attacks in the preceding 3 months than subjects with normal S-ECP and FeNO (51% vs. 25%, P = 0.001). This was not found for subjects with singly elevated S-ECP (P = 0.14) or FeNO (P = 0.34) levels. Elevated S-ECP and FeNO levels were independently associated with asthma attacks in the preceding 3 months after adjusting for potential confounders (OR (95% CI) 4.2 (2.0-8.8). Conclusions Simultaneously elevated FeNO and S-ECP levels were related to a higher likelihood of asthma attacks in the preceding 3 months. This indicates that there is a value in measuring both FeNO and systemic eosinophilic inflammation in patients with asthma to identify individuals at high risk of exacerbations. Clinical relevance FeNO and S-ECP are markers for inflammation in asthma, but are dependent on different inflammatory pathways and weakly correlated. Simultaneous measurements of both offer better risk characterization of adult asthmatics.\n", "embeddings": ["-0.456291", "1.2385097", "1.0417991", "-0.5109429", "0.13488755", "-0.7029529", "-0.05378261", "2.8947678", "-0.74588037", "0.25419974", "-0.91762555", "-1.8096728", "0.35565916", "0.29998437", "-0.22912343", "-1.1411111", "0.92001945", "0.9723337", "-0.08695839", "-1.7188257", "0.67847955", "-2.5665696", "0.48065984", "0.307948", "-0.790507", "0.18399046", "-0.1954377", "-0.78538483", "-0.96760005", "0.4768199", "0.2872611", "-0.74960804", "0.22755496", "-0.63246673", "0.658125", "1.4491669", "0.9250526", "-0.98096555", "-0.24434093", "1.2854236", "0.57804286", "-1.377656", "0.020023976", "1.4571339", "-0.5499623", "-0.4059299", "0.46612978", "0.68069935", "-0.22250444", "-1.357997", "1.9811395", "-2.135572", "-0.25066495", "-0.59856296", "-0.43540153", "-0.026317632", "0.41425264", "0.11848261", "-0.07831238", "-0.7082046", "-0.9096771", "-0.8876808", "0.021157099", "1.2963532", "-1.1433691", "1.0043044", "0.2512749", "0.9360999", "-0.2268758", "1.4677333", "-0.07902222", "0.7752403", "0.21457805", "-0.47805926", "-0.71370137", "0.7359147", "0.052281365", "-1.458418", "-2.2094254", "-0.018918231", "1.1340483", "-0.8966896", "0.10210002", "2.0968773", "-0.7999115", "1.5670958", "-0.24909307", "-0.8535087", "0.60166174", "0.38178417", "1.392163", "0.045276824", "1.4287057", "1.3193702", "1.2301916", "-0.7892166", "-0.18167986", "0.13407934", "-0.24008246", "0.09668884", "-2.4251435", "0.15342425", "1.2281201", "-0.41139442", "-1.8538932", "-1.7435553", "0.47104827", "1.0026202", "-0.43398494", "-0.5730301", "-0.45596388", "-1.8485787", "-0.0861916", "-0.5365255", "0.46589226", "-1.417359", "1.1003548", "-2.1235466", "-0.21122535", "-1.2945927", "0.61564", "-0.27374488", "0.9566582", "-2.473356", "-0.13582982", "-1.54286", "-0.36306617", "-1.2062635", "0.8649609", "-0.42868268", "2.1363616", "0.18618548", "-0.7091575", "-1.5575393", "-0.24963371", "0.5884835", "0.63652223", "1.2618437", "-0.07291221", "-0.7511695", "-1.6251023", "-0.38685396", "0.82101226", "-0.4880413", "0.03492479", "-0.8392517", "-0.5580693", "-0.49476096", "0.28238392", "-0.010122286", "-0.52366596", "0.68073136", "1.3240094", "1.2644836", "-1.2710366", "1.4393095", "1.2703407", "0.5091848", "0.12263708", "-0.8730031", "0.7584024", "-0.011142704", "1.2606286", "-0.5383443", "0.6538663", "1.2099079", "-0.11074535", "-0.04861811", "0.4185777", "-0.45789635", "-0.16866827", "0.52429444", "0.4319208", "0.08218528", "0.28426948", "0.5146914", "-0.27950168", "-1.2383254", "1.724557", "-1.5707501", "0.070008956", "-0.1296004", "-1.3815707", "-1.5625359", "2.3249416", "-1.4334998", "1.2790256", "-0.91230434", "-0.45644888", "-0.5438717", "0.43945396", "-0.29439217", "-2.131473", "-0.8598049", "1.8673692", "-0.6239852", "-0.33213782", "0.77828324", "-0.07569459", "0.1378035"]}
