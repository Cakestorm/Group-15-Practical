{"body": "Background: Functionalized nanoparticles (NPs) are one promising tool for detecting specific molecular targets and combine molecular biology and nanotechnology aiming at modern imaging. We aimed at ligand-directed delivery with a suitable target-biomarker to detect early pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Promising targets are galectins (Gal), due to their strong expression in and on PDAC-cells and occurrence at early stages in cancer precursor lesions, but not in adjacent normal tissues. Results: Molecular probes (10-29 AA long peptides) derived from human tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) were selected as binding partners to galectins. Affinity constants between the synthesized t-PA peptides and Gal were determined by microscale thermophoresis. The 29 AA-long t-PA-peptide-1 with a lactose-functionalized serine revealed the strongest binding properties to Gal-1 which was 25-fold higher in comparison with the native t-PA protein and showed additional strong binding to Gal-3 and Gal-4, both also over-expressed in PDAC. t-PA-peptide-1 was selected as vector moiety and linked covalently onto the surface of biodegradable iron oxide nanoparticles (NPs). In particular, CAN-doped maghemite NPs (CAN-Mag), promising as contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), were selected as magnetic core and coated with different biocompatible polymers, such as chitosan (CAN-Mag-Chitosan NPs) or polylactic co glycolic acid (PLGA) obtaining polymeric nanoparticles (CAN-Mag@PNPs), already approved for drug delivery applications. The binding efficacy of t-PA-vectorized NPs determined by exposure to different pancreatic cell lines was up to 90%, as assessed by flow cytometry. The in vivo targeting and imaging efficacy of the vectorized NPs were evaluated by applying murine pancreatic tumor models and assessed by 1.5 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The t-PA-vectorized NPs as well as the protease-activated NPs with outer shell decoration (CAN-Mag@PNPs-PEG-REGAcp-PEG/tPA-pep1Lac) showed clearly detectable drop of subcutaneous and orthotopic tumor staining-intensity indicating a considerable uptake of the injected NPs. Post mortem NP deposition in tumors and organs was confirmed by Fe staining of histopathology tissue sections. Conclusions: The targeted NPs indicate a fast and enhanced deposition of NPs in the murine tumor models. The CAN-Mag@PNPs-PEG-REGAcp-PEG/tPA-pep1Lac interlocking steps strategy of NPs delivery and deposition in pancreatic tumor is promising.\n", "embeddings": ["1.058001", "0.012257312", "1.6862458", "0.45211002", "2.1536236", "-0.84814227", "0.71462816", "1.5584505", "-3.4155853", "1.0564727", "0.38623965", "-3.2567825", "0.7659815", "0.26613265", "-1.8640419", "-0.24169531", "-0.5615073", "0.017544787", "-0.18873179", "-1.9323449", "-1.254627", "0.19136134", "0.75948477", "0.5716143", "-0.69039935", "0.5159133", "-1.8079019", "2.5168948", "-0.50520134", "1.6483804", "0.61484903", "0.9565961", "0.011985963", "-0.44725138", "-0.5116623", "0.8520078", "1.191176", "0.5553273", "-1.3410487", "0.8344605", "1.1605811", "-0.12638633", "0.19859302", "-1.5148926", "3.398381", "-0.394542", "-0.117018834", "-3.560582", "0.29782814", "1.7336028", "-1.026162", "0.08389662", "-0.13401522", "-0.54190874", "-0.17905252", "0.38263434", "-2.447009", "0.6837576", "-2.2976568", "0.047728736", "-0.33880076", "-0.20659842", "-1.6701534", "-0.25117934", "0.44021532", "-0.38832098", "2.978653", "2.1424265", "-1.2999783", "1.7031847", "-0.44518048", "1.3127108", "0.27767983", "0.5232357", "0.47221994", "0.9975709", "0.9890272", "-0.38164964", "1.0282056", "-1.2254119", "0.9922294", "-1.044802", "0.94349694", "1.1442358", "-1.9677924", "0.30396166", "0.062473804", "-1.2776728", "-1.6543614", "-0.13835682", "1.7760879", "-0.8181385", "-1.6761247", "0.5517838", "0.7393594", "1.2805088", "-0.9029345", "-0.2798903", "-2.4201753", "1.8044219", "-1.503557", "-1.2572467", "-0.98095256", "-1.8014995", "0.3277231", "-0.018472249", "0.65656984", "-0.26522353", "-2.376958", "0.22322352", "0.3764294", "-0.26078582", "-1.4917158", "1.9785985", "2.0963075", "-2.6609175", "0.9365695", "-1.860729", "-3.0076456", "-0.929814", "-0.7542242", "1.74762", "-1.1397935", "-0.056499384", "1.9140831", "-0.291558", "-1.1452881", "-1.0293534", "-0.41642943", "-1.9055116", "0.45195007", "0.7638219", "-0.046016082", "-0.3512163", "2.6530962", "-0.13071561", "-0.81847286", "-2.1660671", "-1.3611716", "-0.39601827", "-0.26658994", "-1.3983454", "0.34658173", "-1.220939", "-0.8022185", "-0.8585796", "1.055437", "1.7055123", "-2.0696347", "1.7358242", "-0.1847755", "-0.94455385", "-2.4314144", "1.3861338", "-1.0216008", "-1.8219488", "0.31482834", "0.915096", "-0.6361726", "1.2684785", "0.4088757", "-0.8068507", "0.9559191", "0.46930754", "-0.54419374", "1.1333703", "0.040592056", "-2.0912218", "-0.9238868", "-0.37752315", "-0.9881244", "0.98385584", "-0.64896655", "-0.028819168", "0.85465825", "0.042603776", "0.1663208", "2.082635", "2.4380124", "0.5124278", "1.2332816", "0.17558044", "-0.1978318", "-0.5297653", "0.3219087", "2.1445074", "0.14787571", "-1.8988065", "1.1893153", "2.349834", "0.4983311", "-0.78378993", "1.3779141", "2.2008848", "1.9850615", "1.4121052", "-2.0623274", "-0.37443486", "-0.6647116", "1.2885292"]}
