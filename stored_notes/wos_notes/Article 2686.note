{"title": "Article 2686", "body": "The global and UK drive for a low-carbon dioxide environment, as well as a secure and affordable energy supply, has encouraged nuclear power to play a core role in the UK energy mix: the UK landscape today houses eight large nuclear plants (15 reactors) reported to generate about 21% of UK electricity.
