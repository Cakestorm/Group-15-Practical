{"title": "Article 427", "body": "A signal- and transient-current boosting (STCB) circuit is proposed and applied to a single-stage amplifier driving large capacitive loads. The proposed STCB circuit provides gain-bandwidth product (GBW) extension, slew-rate (SR) improvement and gain enhancement to the amplifier, with only slight alterations to the frequency response and transient response of the single-stage amplifier driving large capacitive loads. No on-chip capacitor or resistor is required. The STCB amplifier is fabricated in a commercial 0.18-mu m CMOS technology. The active chip area is 0.00705 mm(2). The supply is 1.8 V, and the current consumption is 20.3 mu A. The capacitive load (C-O) ranges from about 4.4 nF to 19 nF. The measured results with a similar to 19-nF load show the small-signal figure-of-merit (FOMS = GBW . C-O/power) and the large-signal large-figure-of-merit (FOML = SR . C-O/power) are 150345 MHz . pF/mW and 31213 V/mu s . pF/mW, respectively, which correspond to improvements of 1.52 times and 1.36 times, respectively, to the prior art. The achieved phase margin and gain margin are 80.8 degrees and 36.3 dB, respectively.\n", "text": "A signal- and transient-current boosting (STCB) circuit is proposed and applied to a single-stage amplifier driving large capacitive loads.
