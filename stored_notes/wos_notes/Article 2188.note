{"body": "BackgroundThere is increasing popularity of high-power lasers for surgical debridement and antimicrobial therapy in the management of peri-implantitis and periodontal therapy. Removal of the noxious foci would naturally promote tissue healing directly. However, there are also anecdotal reports of better healing around routine high-power laser procedures. The precise mechanisms mediating these effects remain to be fully elucidated. This work examines these low-dose laser bystander effects on oral human epithelial and fibroblasts, particularly focusing on the role of human -defensin 2 (HBD-2 or DEFB4A), a potent factor capable of antimicrobial effects and promoting wound healing. Material and MethodsLaser treatments were performed using a near-infrared laser (810 nm diode) at low doses. Normal human oral keratinocytes and fibroblast cells were used and HBD-2 mRNA and protein expression was assessed with real time polymerase chain reaction, western blotting and immunostaining. Role of transforming growth factor (TGF)-1 signaling in this process was dissected using pathway-specific small molecule inhibitors. ResultsWe observed laser treatments robustly induced HBD-2 expression in an oral fibroblast cell line compared to a keratinocyte cell line. Low-dose laser treatments results in activation of the TGF-1 pathway that mediated HBD-2 expression. The two arms of TGF-1 signaling, Smad and non-Smad are involved in laser-mediated HBD-2 expression. ConclusionsLaser-activated TGF-1 signaling and induced expression of HBD-2, both of which are individually capable of promoting healing in tissues adjacent to high-power surgical laser applications. Moreover, the use of low-dose laser therapy itself can provide additional therapeutic benefits for effective clinical management of periodontal or peri-implant disease.\n", "embeddings": ["-0.14311434", "-0.18488449", "-0.22628744", "-0.20846365", "0.43698838", "-2.1715448", "-0.9817593", "0.976512", "-1.0998378", "0.24203119", "-0.6587171", "-0.47652468", "-0.63939434", "-0.57534176", "-2.510224", "-2.7104821", "0.32114157", "-0.10117808", "-0.3097944", "-0.23228557", "1.1323103", "0.51261747", "-0.46336553", "-0.17895849", "-1.0173035", "-1.1302679", "-0.85879666", "1.2168012", "-2.1877723", "-1.1238313", "2.6119206", "1.5377432", "0.21638176", "0.35147145", "0.62542504", "1.6462954", "-1.0611027", "-1.0066472", "2.004807", "-0.5712845", "1.0481557", "-0.26822802", "-1.4692562", "-1.5857903", "-0.20236963", "-0.04872744", "-1.1342258", "0.37216324", "1.6907637", "0.3144604", "0.4948591", "-0.106538504", "-0.41129363", "0.09235058", "-0.44312885", "0.50921357", "-0.4090815", "-1.5023232", "-1.6178551", "-0.16650745", "-0.6106706", "-0.96107244", "2.0931425", "-1.0738516", "-1.545051", "-0.21965814", "2.3727171", "1.669119", "-1.8850712", "-0.3800709", "1.0106107", "0.70550716", "1.2910798", "0.083201736", "0.43400672", "1.0153612", "1.111516", "-0.894926", "-1.0258721", "-0.2168022", "1.5029281", "-0.04756897", "-0.5512559", "-0.3588155", "-0.27475855", "-1.4412187", "0.020492384", "0.7157612", "0.38949293", "-0.13501444", "-0.3548025", "0.8816917", "-1.037609", "-0.33736745", "1.4439805", "0.46670517", "-1.6836737", "-0.5803967", "-0.5739316", "-0.07572328", "-0.07967993", "-0.25720584", "0.24859427", "0.79049534", "-0.78159726", "-1.1495885", "-1.1557581", "-0.14020263", "-0.75136644", "-0.08223638", "-0.48712158", "-0.43176666", "-0.30254197", "0.67155886", "0.95104945", "0.044977576", "1.1301131", "-0.5129565", "-1.242375", "-0.53819716", "-0.8868203", "1.9878635", "1.9975394", "0.07971489", "1.1086825", "1.1287866", "-0.26772916", "0.7826348", "0.39489836", "0.77806515", "-0.5534773", "-0.2962311", "0.21996696", "0.2230678", "0.4967643", "0.39565057", "0.106990494", "0.0035462945", "0.29534078", "0.60926354", "-0.92547745", "-0.71051866", "1.9523225", "-1.9725196", "1.4203335", "-0.12200036", "-0.40381238", "-0.8386543", "1.059314", "0.7734825", "1.1332506", "-0.6481225", "-0.07624775", "-1.0821099", "-1.0750523", "-0.15602273", "0.14888391", "0.40150195", "-1.4140387", "0.41457117", "0.3654864", "1.6215284", "0.28923395", "0.88654256", "-0.55686307", "1.5524886", "-0.37297627", "0.32560918", "-1.7190492", "-0.6491582", "-1.3014472", "-0.8034038", "-0.07769699", "-0.018033408", "1.3858649", "0.82709205", "-0.1789917", "1.9388734", "0.87081707", "0.014266442", "-1.1078571", "0.08052359", "-0.030401118", "0.72237045", "-1.05182", "-0.5927287", "0.7983356", "1.1790086", "-1.0217214", "-0.2698111", "0.7832998", "-1.3292772", "-0.18327138", "-0.1495287", "-0.84125185", "-0.055712655", "0.61873513", "-0.6587213", "-0.7305139", "-1.6534824"]}
