{"body": "Background: Norovirus (NV) infection has been reported as a cause of severe chronic diarrhea in transplant recipients, but this entity remains under-recognized in clinical practice, leading to diagnostic delays. Transplant clinicians should become familiar with this syndrome in order to facilitate early detection and management. Methods: Demographic, clinical, and outcomes variables were summarized from a series of transplant recipients with positive stool NV reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays at Johns Hopkins in 2013-2014. Factors associated with longer duration of symptoms were compared using random forest analysis. Results: Thirty-one of 193 (16%) transplant recipients who were tested for NV had positive stool RT-PCRs. Symptoms included diarrhea (100%), nausea/vomiting (58%), abdominal pain (52%), and wasting (35%). Acute kidney injury occurred in 23%, and persisted in 21% after 6months. Median duration of diarrheal symptoms was 4months (range, <1-20) and 11/31 (35.4%) patients had relapses after improvement. Wasting, incompatible kidney transplant status, and plasmapheresis were associated with longer diarrhea durations. Treatments included nitazoxanide (in 74%), reduction of immunosuppression (58%), and intravenous immunoglobulin (32%). Six patients died, but no deaths were attributed to NV. Conclusions: It is important for clinicians to recognize that NV can cause severe chronic diarrhea in transplant recipients. In this series, receipt of a human leukocyte antigen- and/or blood type-incompatible kidney transplant, and plasmapheresis were associated with longer symptom duration.\n", "embeddings": ["-0.830898", "-1.200705", "0.9638783", "0.21265881", "-0.74514306", "-0.034295626", "0.9909508", "1.8402832", "0.005877963", "0.89195323", "0.115703024", "-0.9066926", "1.3310919", "-0.5038048", "-0.7630286", "-0.02114854", "-0.01420384", "0.56180453", "0.7636915", "-1.0479616", "-0.48459226", "0.57983035", "-0.2651567", "-0.3532447", "-1.3294067", "0.489743", "1.8452163", "0.009403851", "-0.7725931", "0.64773804", "-0.11241821", "0.30519232", "1.2709419", "0.14419991", "0.51040584", "0.80921334", "-0.08786472", "-0.63718545", "0.30431202", "-0.47877896", "0.29467618", "-1.4910086", "0.8463979", "-0.5669819", "1.806441", "1.169636", "0.69678694", "0.21168011", "1.0231928", "0.27305973", "1.837802", "-0.00857593", "-0.008252157", "0.3924767", "0.11529859", "0.19226705", "-0.43143818", "0.7585557", "-0.33299124", "-0.04064968", "0.529539", "0.16836888", "0.5989293", "1.1098701", "-0.6203268", "-0.63364726", "0.5512768", "0.47299623", "0.38311082", "1.6942196", "0.74094903", "0.9367138", "0.24902594", "-0.58053875", "1.2769897", "1.8913414", "-0.32064825", "-1.4747138", "0.12093202", "0.9237353", "-1.3688151", "-0.86643285", "-0.20106634", "1.7811613", "-0.4120609", "-0.8550551", "-1.9522234", "-1.2611607", "0.62740934", "-0.013451443", "0.59045166", "0.24223623", "-0.38962406", "0.23960222", "0.682714", "-1.5619179", "1.8725035", "0.41979623", "-0.34294102", "1.1738292", "-0.008198474", "0.20714365", "1.6865777", "-0.25669926", "0.60565645", "-2.464961", "-0.47119266", "1.7061403", "-2.197909", "-1.2044758", "-0.5829477", "-0.00842913", "-0.37924618", "1.0450007", "0.4999236", "0.2032127", "1.3467693", "-0.9694714", "0.31548557", "-2.5093925", "0.33013391", "0.20004748", "1.0236536", "-1.6090509", "-0.32390195", "0.10880776", "0.86533725", "0.050126072", "1.1418748", "-0.4466335", "1.1858593", "-0.6141265", "-1.266578", "0.43997732", "0.47973314", "1.1470159", "-0.5175772", "-0.09773408", "0.4074488", "-0.7570938", "0.43155771", "-1.1629971", "-1.319805", "0.40083596", "-0.2400102", "-0.22845237", "1.0096875", "0.98674893", "0.49194467", "1.0398918", "-0.5980505", "0.14109096", "1.0027398", "0.49908906", "-2.2025456", "1.9691868", "0.023756312", "0.33949673", "-0.20048888", "-1.8879904", "0.19768167", "0.67418563", "-0.89381886", "0.41003084", "-0.50510794", "0.5390063", "-0.021883612", "-2.0167773", "-0.8794693", "0.74606025", "0.34311828", "-0.53214896", "1.2070255", "-0.1315857", "0.53045005", "2.1442187", "0.6157117", "1.238467", "1.5030015", "-0.33766824", "-0.022214517", "-0.22446875", "-0.13499407", "-0.50004935", "0.26317593", "-1.0692217", "-1.4719187", "0.46457237", "1.0101674", "0.5763946", "1.2122418", "-0.503225", "-0.5760037", "0.63439226", "-0.14994517", "0.2695445", "1.3344953", "-1.565022", "0.31894532", "-0.41311595"]}
