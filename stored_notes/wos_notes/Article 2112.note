The aims of this study were to analyze CK expression and to evaluate the diagnostic application of CKs in human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods: mRNA expression of CK5, CK6, CK14, CK15, CK17, and CK19 was analyzed by Northern blotting. Protein expression of CK5/6, CK7, CK14, CK17, and CK18 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays. Results: Northern blotting showed that CKs were highly expressed in human bronchial epithelial cells and/or small airway epithelial cells. In NSCLC cell lines, the expression pattern of CKs was heterogeneous. Regarding protein expression of CKs in 95 primary lung tumors, expression of CK5/6, CK14, and CK17 proteins was increased in squamous cell carcinomas compared to adenocarcinomas (ADC; p = 0.001, p = 0.030, and p = 0.001, respectively), and higher expression was significantly associated with lower grading (p = 0.006, p = 0.002, and p = 0.001, respectively), while increased expression of CK7 and CK18 was observed in ADC (p = 0.001, respectively). Conclusions: Our data suggest that CK5/6, CK7, CK14, CK17, and CK18 have diagnostic value in the subclassification of NSCLC. Copyright (C) 2011 S.
