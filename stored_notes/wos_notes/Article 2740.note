{"title": "Article 2740", "body": "The present study investigated the correlation and significance of HOX transcript antisense RNA (HOTAIR) and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related factors in the occurrence and metastasis of esophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC) progression. The mRNA and protein expression levels of HOTAIR and EMT-related factors were detected in 96 ESCC and para-carcinoma tissues using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis. The expression levels of these factors, and the correlation between these factors and clinicopathological characteristics were subsequently analyzed. HOTAIR mRNA expression levels were significantly higher in ESCC compared with in para-carcinoma tissues, and HOTAIR mRNA expression levels were significantly higher in the groups with lymph node involvement or organ metastasis compared with the group without. Furthermore, HOTAIR expression levels demonstrated a significant increasing trend from well-differentiated cancer to poorly differentiated cancer. The mRNA and protein expression levels of zinc finger protein SNAI1 (Snail) and beta-catenin in ESCC were significantly higher compared with para-carcinoma tissues, whereas E-cadherin mRNA and protein expression levels were lower in ESCC tissues compared with in para-carcinoma tissues. Snail mRNA and protein expression levels were also significantly higher in groups with lymph node involvement or organ metastasis compared with those without, and beta-catenin protein expression levels were significantly higher in the groups with lymph node involvement or organ metastasis compared with the group without. In the 96 ESCC tissues, HOTAIR mRNA expression levels were positively correlated with Snail mRNA and protein expression levels, and were negatively correlated with E-cadherin expression levels. HOTAIR mRNA expression levels were also positively correlated with beta-catenin mRNA expression levels. In conclusion, HOTAIR may be involved in carcinogenesis and metastasis, and may induce the expression of EMT-related factors; detection of these factors may assist in early diagnosis and prognostic prediction.\n", "text": "The present study investigated the correlation and significance of HOX transcript antisense RNA (HOTAIR) and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related factors in the occurrence and metastasis of esophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC) progression.
