{"title": "Article 1777", "body": "This paper presents the optimal designs of two analogue complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) amplifier circuits, namely differential amplifier with current mirror load and two-stage operational amplifier. A modified Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), called Craziness-based Particle Swarm Optimization (CRPSO) technique is applied to minimize the total MOS area of the designed circuits. CRPSO is a highly modified version of conventional PSO, which adopts a number of random variables and has a better and faster exploration and exploitation capability in the multidimensional search space. Integration of craziness factor in the fundamental velocity term of PSO not only brings diversity in particles but also pledges convergence close to global best solution. The proposed CRPSO-based circuit optimization technique is reassured to be free from the intrinsic disadvantages of premature convergence and stagnation, unlike Differential Evolution (DE), Harmony Search (HS), Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The simulation results achieved for the two analogue CMOS amplifier circuits establish the efficacy of the proposed CRPSO-based approach over those of DE, HS, ABC and PSO in terms of convergence haste, design conditions and design goals. The optimally designed analogue CMOS amplifier circuits occupy the least MOS area and show the best performance parameters like gain and power dissipation, in compared with the other reported literature.
