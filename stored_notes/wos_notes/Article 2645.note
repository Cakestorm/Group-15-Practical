{"title": "Article 2645", "body": "One of the most important issues in strategic management is enhancing employees' motivation to contribute in the implementation of strategies; because they usually do not pay necessary attention to strategies. Accordingly, it is required to consider and calculate their roles in implementing strategies. In terms of employees' role in the organization, they have managerial (goal setter) and/or non-managerial (non-goal setter) role. We are looking for a strategic performance measurement method to involve both roles. Since there was not a pervasive method in the literature to cover both roles properly, this research introduces a method that measures and calculates the strategic performance of employees based on two main parts: Project effectiveness (for managerial roles) and project efficiency (for non-managerial roles). This method tested on a sample of employees in Hormozgan Cement Company. Results show a significant difference between employees who participated and those who did not participate in implementation of strategies in their performance value. Achieved values are tangible and traceable; therefore, employees can have a proper sense and reaction to outputs of this method.\n", "text": "One of the most important issues in strategic management is enhancing employees' motivation to contribute in the implementation of strategies; because they usually do not pay necessary attention to strategies.
