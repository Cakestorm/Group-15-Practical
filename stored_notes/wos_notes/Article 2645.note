{"title": "Article 2645", "body": {"ops": [{"insert": "One of the most important issues in strategic management is enhancing employees' motivation to contribute in the implementation of strategies; because they usually do not pay necessary attention to strategies.

We are looking for a strategic performance measurement method to involve both roles. Since there was not a pervasive method in the literature to cover both roles properly, this research introduces a method that measures and calculates the strategic performance of employees based on two main parts: Project effectiveness (for managerial roles) and project efficiency (for non-managerial roles). This method tested on a sample of employees in Hormozgan Cement Company. Results show a significant difference between employees who participated and those who did not participate in implementation of strategies in their performance value.
