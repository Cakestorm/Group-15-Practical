{"title": "Article 1132", "body": "The translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP) is an important component of the target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling pathway, the major regulator of cell growth in animals and fungi. Despite its relevance, knowledge on plant TCTP homologs is still limited. In the present study, the full-length BoTCTP cDNA was isolated from a cabbage (Brassica oleracea L.) cDNA library. The BoTCTP cDNA encodes a polypeptide of 168 amino acids and shared the highly conserved GTPase binding surface in all of the species analyzed. Northern blotting analysis showed that BoTCTP was specifically expressed in the root and stem. Furthermore, the expression of BoTCTP could be obviously enhanced by stress stimuli, including high temperature and salt stresses, while no significant changes in the BoTCTP expression were observed under ABA stress. Functional analysis of BoTCTP was performed by the silencing of BoTCTP using RNA interference (RNAi) and the BoTCTP RNAi plants exhibited reduced vegetative growth rate and decreased tolerance of the cold, high temperature, and salt stresses. The reported results clearly suggest that the BoTCTP gene is involved in the regulation of both growth and stress response in cabbage.\n", "text": "The translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP) is an important component of the target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling pathway, the major regulator of cell growth in animals and fungi.
