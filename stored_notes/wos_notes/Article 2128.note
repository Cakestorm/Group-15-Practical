{"body": "The transcriptional patterns of mitochondrial respiratory related genes were investigated in cytoplasmic male-sterile and fertile maintainer lines of stem mustard, Brassica juncea. There were numerous differences in nad2 (subunit 2 of NADH dehydrogenase) between stem mustard CMS and its maintainer line. One novel open reading frame, hereafter named orfB gene, was located at the downstream of mitochondrial nad2 gene in the CMS. The novel orfB gene had high similarity with YMF19 family protein, orfB in Raphanus sativus, Helianthus annuus, Nicotiana tabacum and Beta vulgaris, orfB-CMS in Daucus carota, atp8 gene in Arabidopsis thaliana, 5' flanking of orf224 in B. napus (nap CMS) and 5' flanking of orf220 gene in CMS Brassica juncea. Three copies probed by specific fragment (amplified by primers of nad2F and nad2R from CMS) were found in the CMS line following Southern blotting digested with HindIII, but only a single copy in its maintainer line. Meanwhile, two transcripts were shown in the CMS line following Northern blotting while only one transcript was detected in the maintainer line, which were probed by specific fragment (amplified by primers of nad2F and nad2R from CMS). Meanwhile, the expression of nad2 gene was reduced in CMS bud compared to that in its maintainer line. We thus suggested that nad2 gene may be co-transcripted with CMS-associated orfB gene in the CMS. In addition, the specific fragment that was amplified by primers of nad2F and nad2R just spanned partial sequences of nad2 gene and orfB gene. Such alterations in the nad2 gene would impact the activity of NADH dehydrogenase, and subsequently signaling, inducing the expression of nuclear genes involved in male sterility in this type of cytoplasmic male sterility.\n", "embeddings": ["0.14277609", "-1.183522", "-1.6531034", "-1.4767427", "1.3854021", "-0.925093", "0.41307738", "-0.41143802", "0.59000826", "0.72486985", "0.3798217", "0.89275986", "-1.2182823", "0.6419732", "-0.38572916", "-0.2365533", "1.1083968", "1.2175936", "-0.3933512", "-1.4906766", "-1.3726057", "-1.3153306", "-0.6972631", "-0.70171654", "-0.7969458", "-0.3963686", "-1.1187111", "-0.63232666", "-0.33925802", "1.8652427", "-0.26585492", "0.62089217", "-1.5102447", "-0.76452875", "0.21165633", "-0.17109802", "0.14269812", "-1.2216389", "0.95915186", "-0.7884549", "-1.4706655", "0.8222565", "-2.1473138", "-2.0435245", "0.80856687", "0.15433834", "0.27739024", "-1.1368586", "2.313331", "-0.25409254", "0.5259868", "0.9666844", "0.51613843", "1.9971973", "0.28617415", "0.19215858", "0.92332864", "-1.0956267", "-0.757604", "0.89392626", "0.4307393", "0.4299547", "0.8432627", "0.3659096", "0.58466035", "0.6221268", "0.77246964", "-1.0449796", "1.2381574", "-0.063735686", "0.79421693", "-0.15513884", "0.78359807", "-0.34676263", "0.9140393", "0.2895042", "1.5442153", "-0.6067202", "-0.09600558", "0.7177865", "-0.081805974", "-0.09321816", "-0.9179618", "1.4200026", "-0.9870893", "-0.7890698", "0.39252663", "2.1189895", "0.054832295", "1.0414613", "2.0280025", "2.172152", "-0.28116754", "0.054667965", "-0.35710174", "-0.32491565", "-0.4095406", "-1.3405744", "1.636033", "-0.40158418", "0.71797717", "-0.9185386", "2.1083047", "0.012851832", "-0.10819303", "1.4044077", "0.38980734", "-0.5906511", "0.17207837", "-1.1448901", "-0.5419016", "-0.84403896", "0.5991919", "-0.20802523", "0.94147235", "-2.1887956", "0.98318183", "-0.84362483", "0.30925775", "-0.14719214", "-0.28068256", "0.20372462", "1.3527459", "0.13269332", "-0.21044584", "1.2200929", "1.3549904", "-0.09005221", "-0.34754285", "-1.3769281", "1.8018776", "0.3048946", "-1.0892752", "1.7087775", "-0.8020559", "1.872443", "-0.01661469", "-0.51155204", "-1.3408087", "-1.4784887", "0.38856426", "-2.2508457", "-0.80226165", "-0.5500084", "-0.4165431", "0.43559816", "-1.4307303", "0.9003808", "-1.7828047", "0.843103", "-0.069456555", "-1.1369119", "-0.64018697", "0.15580946", "-0.89336276", "2.0736556", "0.42421862", "0.8751968", "-0.15817834", "0.061974254", "0.9995326", "-0.035018582", "-0.8927449", "-0.09535742", "-0.6450551", "2.6667368", "2.911883", "-1.5525347", "-2.1921058", "1.2171882", "-0.061447535", "0.18922031", "0.32196182", "-0.6939661", "1.2007141", "-1.3121463", "0.8160798", "0.3688853", "1.088664", "-0.9013517", "0.36249858", "-0.58758044", "1.3099712", "-0.29783866", "1.3307745", "-0.330619", "1.5967413", "-0.1924895", "2.9491277", "-0.84133524", "0.3345931", "-1.0533085", "-0.8066476", "-0.29689318", "-0.0037825315", "1.8568121", "0.63850415", "-1.100344", "-0.1455803", "-0.47922668"]}
