Recombinant human CIFN (rhCIFN) has previously been expressed in Escherichia coli using isopropyl--d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), a non-metabolizable and expensive compound, as inducer. For economical and commercial-scale recombinant protein production, it is greatly needed to increase the product yield in a limited time frame to reduce the processing cost. To reduce the cost of production of rhCIFN in E. coli, induction was accomplished by using lactose instead of IPTG. Lactose induction (14g/L) in shake flask experiment resulted in higher yield as compared with 1mM IPTG.

In the present study, an attempt was made to develop a low cost process for producing quality product with high purity.
