This study aims to predict the electricity load demand using a hybrid method that incorporates Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) algorithms. The proposed EMD-SVR method integrates the EMD method to SVR algorithm by using EMD as a denoising step on the training data.

Experimental results are conducted on 3 electricity load datasets from different countries and the proposed method is compared with SVR algorithm using different feature vectors as well. It is shown that the proposed algorithm outperforms the SVR and non-feature used denoised-SVR algorithm on electricity load forecasting. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
