This study aims to predict the electricity load demand using a hybrid method that incorporates Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) algorithms.

Experimental results are conducted on 3 electricity load datasets from different countries and the proposed method is compared with SVR algorithm using different feature vectors as well.
