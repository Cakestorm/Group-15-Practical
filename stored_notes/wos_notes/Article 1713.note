{"body": "Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) tools can identify health-related quality of life (HRQOL) domains that could differentially affect disease progression. Cirrhotics are highly prone to hospitalizations and re-hospitalizations, but the current clinical prognostic models may be insufficient, and thus studying the contribution of individual HRQOL domains could improve prognostication. Analyze the impact of individual HRQOL PROMIS domains in predicting time to all non-elective hospitalizations and re-hospitalizations in cirrhosis. Outpatient cirrhotics were administered PROMIS computerized tools. The first non-elective hospitalization and subsequent re-hospitalizations after enrollment were recorded. Individual PROMIS domains significantly contributing toward these outcomes were generated using principal component analysis. Factor analysis revealed three major PROMIS domain groups: daily function (fatigue, physical function, social roles/activities and sleep issues), mood (anxiety, anger, and depression), and pain (pain behavior/impact) accounted for 77% of the variability. Cox proportional hazards regression modeling was used for these groups to evaluate time to first hospitalization and re-hospitalization. A total of 286 patients [57 years, MELD 13, 67% men, 40% hepatic encephalopathy (HE)] were enrolled. Patients were followed at 6-month (mth) intervals for a median of 38 mths (IQR 22-47), during which 31% were hospitalized [median IQR mths 12.5 (3-27)] and 12% were re-hospitalized [10.5 mths (3-28)]. Time to first hospitalization was predicted by HE, HR 1.5 (CI 1.01-2.5, p = 0.04) and daily function PROMIS group HR 1.4 (CI 1.1-1.8, p = 0.01), independently. In contrast, the pain PROMIS group were predictive of the time to re-hospitalization HR 1.6 (CI 1.1-2.3, p = 0.03) as was HE, HR 2.1 (CI 1.1-4.3, p = 0.03). Daily function and pain HRQOL domain groups using PROMIS tools independently predict hospitalizations and re-hospitalizations in cirrhotic patients.\n", "embeddings": ["-0.22979562", "-1.3127778", "-1.4731818", "2.5183778", "0.17315257", "1.6637847", "1.6484897", "2.2988422", "0.31425652", "-0.7773018", "-1.2955598", "-0.412815", "1.240297", "-0.31384796", "-1.9715369", "0.5556482", "-1.033916", "0.85721636", "-0.1509943", "-2.647415", "1.0216713", "0.04142434", "1.1650928", "0.40023154", "1.2069151", "0.938146", "-0.35155654", "0.26965183", "-1.0669862", "-0.7821637", "1.2328169", "0.958073", "0.61098444", "-0.120501004", "-0.04343488", "-0.46906728", "-0.12907828", "0.62169015", "0.7402705", "0.4772788", "-1.740359", "0.20428799", "0.7765038", "-0.044983868", "0.7559691", "-0.19997332", "-0.61982507", "0.9146462", "-0.32736552", "-1.8584172", "1.0102924", "-0.15599538", "0.29004765", "-0.3475278", "0.20775183", "1.1443679", "-0.3003366", "0.89795655", "-0.32483625", "-0.089585565", "-0.62642336", "-0.15679309", "0.19168925", "-0.5553224", "-1.112581", "0.31773585", "-1.3772817", "0.35311812", "0.7029983", "0.6249102", "-0.6720782", "-1.6665716", "0.6636828", "0.4077693", "2.0329444", "0.89290076", "-0.49949747", "-1.71803", "-0.47448558", "0.30694175", "-2.3090582", "-1.0802996", "0.72408706", "0.49870923", "0.011063205", "1.0324992", "-0.8567208", "-1.9378533", "-1.4225332", "-2.3194363", "2.1010246", "1.6502904", "0.6582869", "-1.0193458", "0.12761852", "-0.3723206", "1.2943214", "-0.51423204", "-0.24534604", "-0.73767185", "0.19654094", "-1.4216037", "-0.038630698", "-0.8716252", "-1.9367093", "-2.016069", "2.4912744", "-0.2244809", "-1.14059", "0.91255", "-0.047599368", "-0.91837054", "0.2664539", "-0.33486885", "-1.832241", "-2.3505294", "0.19170822", "-0.5705378", "-0.7021101", "-2.164442", "-1.0734224", "-1.6342139", "1.5753204", "1.3196676", "0.10678815", "0.6995004", "-0.69070417", "0.89194834", "0.5692774", "2.395033", "1.0927888", "-0.30443674", "-1.5215534", "0.063709594", "1.3524457", "1.7701995", "0.16402724", "-0.2149495", "-0.47322097", "-0.84866065", "0.11334418", "0.04519197", "0.3328964", "-0.047777604", "0.6395643", "-1.3469265", "0.30708718", "-1.2298127", "-0.58099186", "2.061974", "0.54269403", "-1.8852295", "0.45724294", "0.8964957", "-2.3018515", "0.4654012", "-1.1093074", "0.9811757", "0.6959507", "-0.81284493", "1.1617714", "1.8563255", "1.0876743", "0.61997503", "-0.047255132", "0.9480121", "-0.012320138", "-1.5114759", "-2.221264", "0.7450872", "-0.030574797", "-0.10087514", "1.147368", "-0.5955794", "0.77838755", "0.5974805", "-0.699921", "1.6929082", "-0.035031676", "0.19338357", "-0.37013736", "1.1776195", "0.625891", "0.43444633", "1.0064666", "-0.6694993", "-0.77437335", "2.0977683", "0.38746962", "-0.8308623", "1.3349595", "1.1345592", "-0.18386482", "-2.217924", "0.61471075", "0.24539669", "0.9199997", "0.32258618", "-0.61735344", "-0.9911528"]}
