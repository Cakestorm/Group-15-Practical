To realize the stable levitation and rotation, the corresponding suspending force and torque should be controlled. In this paper, different from the conventional bearingless SRM control, one independent control scheme for levitation force and torque is presented. In the control, a complex control algorithm based on a lookup table is not needed. Torque control is separated from radial force control, and each channel of radial force is independently controlled.
