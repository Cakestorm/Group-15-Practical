{"body": "Objective: The aim of this study was to examine physical and heart rhythm management device malfunction complications after participating in a cardiac rehabilitation program intervention compared with usual care. Method: This study was a clinical trial of 100 patients. After randomization, intervention group patients received 8 cardiac rehabilitation program sessions for 8 weeks and follow-up phone calls. Each session consisted of exercise training, education, and psychological interventions. Data were collected at 3 points in both groups-baseline and 8 and 12 weeks after the first day of the intervention-using a researcher-designed case report form. Data were analyzed using descriptive and nonparametric tests. Results: Of the participants, 59% were men, and the sample was aged 40 to 60 years. At the 8- to 12-week follow-up, there were less physical complications among the cardiac rehabilitation group (P < .001) and no between-group differences in complications related to device malfunction. By heart rhythm device type, cardiac rehabilitation had the greatest efficacy in reducing physical complications in patients with cardioverter/defibrillators. Conclusions: Cardiac rehabilitation reduced physical complications in patients with cardiac rhythm management devices, especially in patients with cardioverter/defibrillators. Cardiac clinical nurse specialists should recommend rehabilitation programs as part of postimplantation rhythm device treatment to decrease the risk of physical complications.\n", "embeddings": ["0.7063316", "-2.1016257", "0.13577867", "1.2336323", "-0.18747593", "-0.37552932", "0.4288129", "-0.3433845", "-0.62693375", "0.18661325", "-0.40563792", "-0.14950727", "-0.34669948", "-0.78591824", "-1.14421", "0.35796484", "-0.30266857", "-0.90131927", "0.58517694", "-1.2288373", "0.20535468", "0.8335435", "0.5828112", "0.32606512", "-0.27512053", "0.97909665", "2.0177011", "-0.9076189", "-0.25624204", "0.12385753", "0.544432", "0.39842123", "2.4750023", "-0.3721536", "-0.57161653", "0.8387042", "-0.54651815", "-0.36709598", "1.2789143", "-0.056773722", "-1.326597", "0.57937616", "0.61468816", "-1.3752404", "0.8025185", "-0.5558835", "-0.1923473", "0.7500579", "-0.6887442", "0.002964112", "0.74310756", "-0.693953", "-0.7911062", "0.13409501", "0.58806676", "0.45836473", "1.3675251", "-0.11990013", "0.16881971", "-0.07109698", "-0.6211282", "0.020979892", "0.20428705", "-0.17809476", "-0.2995497", "-0.9149526", "0.48328802", "0.50075537", "-0.47683686", "1.2113031", "0.60183936", "0.062119156", "0.7133095", "0.75502187", "1.252202", "1.6007875", "0.8984184", "-0.16891517", "-0.7763343", "-0.5309831", "0.69125813", "-0.5828104", "-0.9681686", "1.1160269", "-2.2614224", "-0.33670074", "0.65442955", "-0.1770052", "0.1209225", "-0.35261896", "1.5662844", "1.4378685", "0.6363556", "-1.6236634", "0.7142169", "0.40038964", "-0.29098362", "0.86856914", "0.79210615", "-0.79402196", "0.5797706", "1.4528314", "0.8879704", "0.6330093", "-0.8080169", "-1.5794989", "1.437599", "1.6218994", "-2.0388887", "-1.4648407", "-0.789784", "-1.5132477", "-1.2672085", "0.3990578", "0.080313124", "-1.9135405", "1.3840768", "-0.019323898", "-1.4171449", "-0.9275238", "-0.3413489", "0.33449632", "-0.51370776", "-0.79433185", "-0.7613442", "0.981588", "-0.70797235", "0.2810388", "-1.2901961", "0.1950936", "1.7789999", "0.86325425", "-0.8467989", "-0.079197645", "0.22668606", "0.9267043", "-0.37916207", "1.6679893", "0.47856", "-0.4442039", "0.7839321", "-1.0891687", "-1.1038203", "0.15538976", "-0.35397553", "0.8231664", "0.44789478", "-0.6095306", "1.0806891", "0.34095263", "0.43834582", "-0.4087026", "0.046411257", "0.87836134", "-2.3742855", "-1.0327674", "-1.9757593", "-0.29348645", "-0.8193599", "-0.49179256", "0.9839134", "0.48178634", "-0.29888475", "-1.115617", "0.35414374", "-1.3211529", "-0.20608509", "0.91604143", "-0.23953404", "0.38450342", "-0.9605279", "0.29150552", "-1.4916246", "0.15558778", "0.6890845", "-1.0440764", "1.2893599", "1.2526517", "0.33604708", "-0.1445724", "-0.45970353", "1.6124913", "-0.1635997", "-1.2926748", "-0.234847", "-1.7831798", "0.19544931", "-0.42062178", "0.8571587", "0.83551496", "1.2627022", "-0.21253209", "-0.20290118", "-0.48170546", "-1.5699816", "0.80334115", "-1.3675988", "1.9471229", "-0.30445153", "-0.924304"]}
