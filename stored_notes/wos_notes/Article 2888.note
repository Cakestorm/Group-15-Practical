Exploiting the gel properties of nanocellulose (NC) because of its abundance, sustainability and renewability, we reported the fabrication of a fluorescent hydrogel based on S,N-codoped Graphene Quantum Dots (S,N-GQDs) acting as luminophore and sensitizer. The incorporation of the GQDs into the hydrogel resulted in a significant fluorescence intensity enhancement if compared to GQ.D solutions.
