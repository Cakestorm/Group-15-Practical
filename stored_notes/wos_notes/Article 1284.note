{"body": "Background: Adults, 65 years or older, are the most common age group diagnosed with cancer. However, little is known about their beliefs (representations) regarding treatment-related symptoms or how they make decisions to manage those symptoms at home. Objective: The aim of this study is to explore symptom representation of treatment-related symptoms in older adults with cancer. Methods: A total of 100 older adults in treatment for cancer completed a standardized measure of symptom representation. Demographic and other patient variables were also collected. Analysis of variance, t tests, and Pearson correlations were used for analysis. Results: Fatigue was both the most common and most noted symptom; however, several most noted symptoms were not common. Overall, older adults believed symptoms were caused by either their cancer or treatment and were unsure if symptoms would last a long time. They were able to recognize symptom consequences but were unsure about their ability to control symptoms. Adults who reported more comorbid illnesses and a higher number of symptoms believed that treatment-related symptoms had higher consequences. Conclusions: Findings suggest that older adults experience symptom-related consequences but question the impact that their actions will have on symptom severity. This may contribute to older adult's lack of active symptom self-management. Implications for Practice: Patient education strategies need to address these representations and new interventions may need to be developed to reinforce symptom consequences and empower older adults to self-manage symptoms.\n", "embeddings": ["-0.10051852", "-2.1364245", "0.22578698", "0.608764", "-0.81638587", "-1.3208119", "-0.15015505", "2.2241514", "-0.65606576", "2.085507", "-1.1847762", "-0.18676172", "1.0478443", "0.5324214", "0.03213809", "0.4401623", "0.49422678", "0.117823325", "-0.2961834", "-2.3128693", "0.71710575", "-0.22211352", "0.027038604", "-0.48728797", "-1.3512919", "-1.1364313", "-0.09245774", "0.7446669", "-2.3311563", "1.9142864", "1.4365726", "-0.4856643", "-0.033714466", "-0.57930315", "-1.2596283", "1.090202", "0.33998796", "0.4621598", "2.5717735", "-0.1384068", "-0.7196698", "-1.0044826", "1.103315", "-0.5110607", "0.0417485", "-1.060837", "-1.1925179", "0.8735874", "-0.08691882", "-0.30238566", "0.43075576", "-0.88844544", "-0.00677361", "0.177874", "1.4042312", "0.3595777", "-0.47255763", "0.72638905", "0.20237252", "-0.52750915", "1.950098", "1.4159077", "-0.8025089", "-0.80966043", "-2.4474618", "1.4037005", "-1.9460467", "0.9809986", "-1.7858641", "1.66246", "1.7972441", "-0.70732445", "-0.3609845", "0.10612736", "0.39289755", "0.99067855", "-0.18758298", "0.039242543", "0.070450544", "0.3535055", "-1.61867", "1.2384475", "1.2924743", "0.44868687", "-1.326403", "-0.7482984", "1.1050467", "-2.146647", "-0.37567946", "-0.89930457", "-0.2788738", "0.08620852", "1.1840087", "-0.28021884", "1.171189", "-1.3410795", "-0.118157506", "0.2748035", "-0.024843907", "1.6595349", "-1.4339426", "1.1367291", "0.9279134", "-1.7933414", "-0.2705277", "-2.2317219", "1.1766971", "0.6344318", "-0.6455921", "-2.4454732", "1.1933658", "-0.24536857", "-1.2508496", "-0.6547566", "0.19187236", "0.69849634", "0.482542", "-0.71645707", "0.08549411", "0.72168815", "-0.19301797", "-0.42691147", "0.53107864", "-0.18916678", "0.20515548", "0.35368282", "0.80566037", "-1.0225304", "-0.6670663", "0.5554862", "1.6231486", "-0.031124156", "-0.48849568", "-0.08480991", "1.039609", "-0.35425654", "-0.9114494", "1.0964227", "-1.1635139", "-0.41515425", "1.6132001", "2.2810464", "-1.3013545", "1.4599533", "-0.030037846", "0.13720196", "-0.31637064", "0.62260556", "0.29844844", "-0.39758897", "-1.3053701", "0.23424126", "-1.2742059", "1.4792091", "-0.84666735", "0.82031494", "-0.5613319", "-0.51547384", "0.10997988", "-0.86853373", "-0.9156343", "1.4300013", "0.18552871", "-0.1481299", "0.36317757", "1.1358844", "0.6385991", "0.60131663", "-0.61436266", "1.5052198", "0.078358375", "1.1626161", "0.30624366", "0.3845377", "-0.3282399", "1.0459094", "-1.7177826", "0.29790303", "-0.36751026", "-0.061649144", "0.9271215", "0.429268", "-0.71768594", "0.5555885", "0.35612708", "-1.7363242", "-1.4934009", "-0.09226242", "1.0806932", "-1.1179016", "1.3451265", "-1.0286132", "-0.97061944", "-0.44663393", "0.68198746", "-1.4751401", "-0.5226028", "-0.8227113", "0.60086226", "0.3226578"]}
