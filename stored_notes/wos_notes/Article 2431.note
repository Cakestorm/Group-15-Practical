{"title": "Article 2431", "body": {"ops": [{"insert": "The human gene deleted in malignant brain tumors 1 (DMBT1) is considered to play a role in tumorigenesis and pathogen defense. It encodes a protein with multiple scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) domains, which are involved in recognition and binding of a broad spectrum of bacterial pathogens. The SRCR domains are encoded by highly homologous repetitive exons, whose number in humans may vary from 8 to 13 due to genetic polymorphism. Here, we characterized the porcine DMBTI gene on the mRNA and genomic level. We assembled a 4.5 kb porcine DMBT1 cDNA sequence from RT-PCR amplified seminal vesicle RNA. The porcine DMBT1 cDNA contains an open reading frame of 4050 nt. The transcript gives rise to a putative polypeptide of 1349 amino acids with a calculated mass of 147.9 kDa. Compared to human DMBT1, it contains only four N-terminal SRCR domains. Northern blotting revealed transcripts of similar to 4.7 kb in size in the tissues analyzed. Analysis of ESTs suggested the existence of secreted and transmembrane variants. The porcine DMBT1 gene spans about 54 kb on chromosome 14q28-q29. In contrast to the characterized cDNA, the genomic BAC clone only contained 3 exons coding for N-terminal SRCR domains. In different mammalian DMBT1 orthologs large interspecific differences in the number of SRCR exons and utilization of the transmembrane exon exist. Our data suggest that the porcine DMBT1 gene may share with the human DMBT1 gene additional intraspecific variations in the number of SRCR-coding exons. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
