{"title": "Article 768", "body": "Electrophysiologic studies suggest that autism spectrum disorder is characterized by aberrant anatomic and functional neural circuitry. During normal brain development, pruning and synaptogenesis facilitate ongoing changes in both short- and long-range neural wiring. In developmental disorders such as autism, this process may be perturbed and lead to abnormal neural connectivity. Careful analysis of electrophysiologic connectivity patterns using EEG coherence may provide a way to probe the resulting differences in neurological function between people with and without autism. There is general consensus that electroencephalogram coherence patterns differ between individuals with and without autism spectrum disorders; however, the exact nature of the differences and their clinical significance remain unclear. Here we review recent literature comparing electroencephalogram coherence patterns between patients with autism spectrum disorders or at high risk for autism and their non-autistic or low-risk for autism peers.\n", "text": "Electrophysiologic studies suggest that autism spectrum disorder is characterized by aberrant anatomic and functional neural circuitry.
