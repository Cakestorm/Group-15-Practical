Daphnetin, a naturally occurring catechol from the family thymelaeaceae, has a chemical structure similar to several potent COMT inhibitors reported previously.

Daphnetin and its methylated metabolite (8-O-methyldaphnetin) were found to inhibit COMT-mediated dopamine O-methylation in a dose-dependent manner. The IC50 values for daphnetin (0.51 similar to 0.53 mu M) and 8-O-methyldaphnetin (22.5 similar to 24.3 mu M) were little affected by changes in HLC concentrations. Further kinetic analysis showed the differences in inhibition type and parameters (K-i) between daphnetin (competitive, 0.37 mu M) and 8-O-methyldaphnetin (noncompetitive, 25.7 mu M). Other metabolites, including glucuronidated and sulfated species, showed negligible inhibition against COMT. By using in vitro-in vivo extrapolation (IV-IVE), a 24.3-fold increase in the exposure of the COMT substrates was predicted when they are co-administrated with daphnetin. 3.
