{"body": "1. Finding and developing inhibitors of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) from natural products is highly recommended. Daphnetin, a naturally occurring catechol from the family thymelaeaceae, has a chemical structure similar to several potent COMT inhibitors reported previously. Here the potential of daphnetin and its Phase II metabolites as inhibitors of COMT was investigated with human liver cytosol (HLC). 2. Daphnetin and its methylated metabolite (8-O-methyldaphnetin) were found to inhibit COMT-mediated dopamine O-methylation in a dose-dependent manner. The IC50 values for daphnetin (0.51 similar to 0.53 mu M) and 8-O-methyldaphnetin (22.5 similar to 24.3 mu M) were little affected by changes in HLC concentrations. Further kinetic analysis showed the differences in inhibition type and parameters (K-i) between daphnetin (competitive, 0.37 mu M) and 8-O-methyldaphnetin (noncompetitive, 25.7 mu M). Other metabolites, including glucuronidated and sulfated species, showed negligible inhibition against COMT. By using in vitro-in vivo extrapolation (IV-IVE), a 24.3-fold increase in the exposure of the COMT substrates was predicted when they are co-administrated with daphnetin. 3. With high COMT-inhibiting activity, daphnetin could serve as a lead compound for the design and development of new COMT inhibitors. Also, much attention should be paid to the clinical impact of combination of daphnetin and herbal preparations containing daphnetin with the drugs primarily cleared by COMT.\n", "embeddings": ["-1.2225187", "0.44222683", "0.16302717", "-1.3270025", "0.88036436", "0.4985062", "0.43513733", "1.1387645", "-2.407081", "2.4511962", "-1.3390527", "0.15158236", "-1.090143", "1.6066346", "-1.2287774", "-0.20051108", "1.4935182", "0.64667255", "-0.8155328", "-0.20845152", "-0.76264083", "-0.42962572", "-0.9476539", "-0.023614747", "-0.24687907", "-0.29454812", "-0.6922578", "0.027513582", "-0.21099302", "0.37322712", "0.19927739", "-0.42303967", "-0.8697874", "-1.0712874", "0.80113864", "-0.16372123", "-0.77976495", "0.038147133", "0.5600915", "-0.39140213", "-1.847936", "-0.35724187", "-0.53454286", "-1.4303242", "0.8389322", "-0.8971887", "-0.081875764", "-1.499643", "1.0149571", "0.6138144", "-0.7161075", "-0.24269736", "0.4021423", "0.14227924", "0.5877935", "0.20125617", "-0.9366251", "-0.47280803", "-0.15286772", "-0.4638856", "-1.1804447", "-0.44807246", "-0.18617812", "0.012862628", "1.1965762", "-0.92876226", "2.1383975", "0.77899885", "0.9537024", "1.6332619", "-0.15978798", "1.9983469", "1.3927182", "-0.032492153", "0.88230604", "1.845077", "-0.61130744", "-0.78866595", "0.25787294", "0.12591323", "-0.95495677", "0.58808726", "0.33840102", "0.95466477", "-0.1417412", "-0.31645325", "-0.832997", "0.38805676", "0.25301006", "0.019653223", "0.36830568", "0.90187895", "-0.5600188", "-2.1933308", "0.007497945", "-0.69741684", "-1.9762182", "0.07174098", "1.1503446", "0.48535025", "0.93938076", "0.53149587", "1.3478838", "0.8076345", "1.0131536", "-0.53511333", "-0.1414499", "0.28343582", "-2.0562353", "-0.6323208", "-0.26258704", "0.6705639", "-0.19271879", "-1.298728", "-0.4001543", "-2.0485559", "-0.90706784", "-1.4523607", "-1.8046135", "-1.1244686", "-0.0052598272", "0.46394747", "-2.1991777", "-0.2974534", "-0.07391662", "0.7597016", "1.9195479", "-0.38813108", "0.47819984", "-0.89377815", "1.3199097", "0.6328468", "-1.5016185", "1.246406", "-0.36774796", "0.4482538", "-0.81738544", "0.6536372", "-0.10752046", "0.08734647", "0.27848345", "-0.5096012", "0.2466581", "-0.6713287", "0.031862278", "-0.29727542", "-2.8230605", "1.145309", "0.07196118", "1.4520735", "0.09981696", "-1.8209183", "-0.9191505", "1.235521", "-1.7813878", "-0.65918183", "-0.93017393", "0.5410395", "1.0073655", "-0.24621706", "0.3944102", "1.2103211", "0.5742185", "-0.10175593", "-0.98788184", "-1.1253663", "0.51391834", "-0.94012773", "-0.3231504", "1.1085782", "-1.9997315", "0.505097", "0.23117049", "-0.3508151", "1.4400548", "-2.0249958", "1.4597379", "1.084839", "1.6891148", "-0.12724355", "1.0016769", "0.42509288", "1.3099185", "-0.054491762", "-0.73985153", "0.5958909", "0.7720608", "0.24379145", "-0.1217912", "-0.24704292", "0.7101697", "-0.37893164", "0.5000439", "0.17303313", "1.8520153", "0.19688095", "0.99120945", "-0.89682156", "-0.71345943", "0.12472704"]}
