{"title": "Article 2279", "body": "Lentinula edodes (Shiitake mushroom) is a common edible mushroom that has high nutritional and medical value. Although a number of genes involved in the fruit of the species have been identified, little is known about the process of differentiation from dikaryotic mycelium to primordium. In this study, serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) was applied to determine the gene expression profiles of the dikaryotic mycelium and primordium of L. edodes in an effort to advance our understanding of the molecular basis of fruit body development. A total of 6363 tags were extracted (3278 from the dikaryotic mycelium and 3085 from the primordium), 164 unique tags matched the in-house expressed sequence tag (EST) database. The difference between the expression profiles of the dikaryotic mycelium and primordium suggests that a specific set of genes is required for fruit body development. In the transition from the mycelium to the primordium, different hydrophobins were expressed abundantly, fewer structural genes were expressed, transcription and translation became active, different genes became involved in intracellular trafficking, and stress responses were expressed. These findings advance our understanding of fruit body development. We used cDNA microarray hybridization and Northern blotting to verify the SAGE results, and found SAGE to be highly efficient in the performance of transcriptome analysis. To our knowledge, this is the first SAGE study of a mushroom. (c) 2008 The British Mycological Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
