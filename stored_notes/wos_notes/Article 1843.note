{"body": "On a broader scale, T cell density and localization in colorectal cancer liver metastases have prognostic and predictive implications. As T cell distribution at higher resolutions has not been fully investigated, a detailed resolution analysis of T cell distribution was performed. Patient tissues were divided into 10 mu m distance classes between the tumor border and adjacent normal liver. Thereby, distinct density patterns of T cell localization in relation to the malignant tissue could be detected. At a distance of 20 to 30 mu m to the tumor, a decrease of CD3 T cells is common. Within this area, cytotoxic Granzyme B and CD8(+) T cells were found to be significantly reduced as well as CD163 macrophages were increased and identified to be in close contact with T cells. Our data suggests a physical or functional border within this region. Survival analysis revealed improved overall survival in patients with high T cells numbers at the direct tumor border. Interestingly, the decreased T cells in the 20 to 30 mu m region were also found to be significantly associated with improved survival. Consequently, the detailed localization of T cells, despite blockade, could be associated with improved clinical outcome. The high-resolution analysis represents new insights into relevant heterogenous T cell distributions especially related to clinical responses. As the paradoxical observation of localization-dependent prognostic relevance of T cell densities is only detectable by detailed spatial analyses, this investigation of spatial profiles at higher resolutions is suggested as a new biomarker for survival and response to therapies.\n", "embeddings": ["0.4657285", "0.98733145", "1.0393223", "0.035062063", "0.81063944", "-1.5812902", "-1.2157481", "0.67367136", "-1.5275221", "-0.1252132", "-1.3928648", "1.2477195", "0.28994623", "-0.38138917", "-0.6410849", "-2.0708988", "-1.5075489", "-0.26444417", "-0.97330505", "-2.774515", "-1.47251", "-0.42232087", "0.9133378", "-1.1842376", "0.47070038", "0.46805468", "0.0988529", "-0.34031895", "-0.48275575", "-0.052285645", "0.7054668", "0.012374715", "1.1991583", "-1.0944625", "0.11192049", "1.3063141", "-1.6108818", "-1.674655", "0.6590462", "0.34986585", "0.1216213", "-0.88759774", "0.33458278", "-0.5565495", "0.41609582", "0.9165403", "0.28093678", "-0.9614359", "-1.4903897", "0.19718039", "-1.0813743", "0.9629214", "0.29848456", "-0.2613922", "0.12849148", "0.66028374", "-0.47683692", "-1.4545071", "0.68042177", "-0.06345709", "-0.24537742", "-1.4591134", "0.67627865", "0.48141688", "0.59052736", "1.2924047", "1.4827096", "-1.1246675", "-1.1692963", "0.21961033", "-0.74503064", "0.9376386", "0.57179016", "-0.6313831", "0.79718333", "0.12906091", "-0.67005146", "-0.7195339", "-0.3413884", "-0.45859516", "1.1080154", "0.80931205", "0.060693063", "0.35151485", "-1.3867025", "-0.23395285", "0.3837632", "-2.6667352", "-0.6342976", "-0.6992857", "1.6507164", "-0.055599954", "0.45825633", "0.91645396", "2.0466206", "0.9358102", "-0.28892934", "-0.064978555", "-0.44262353", "-2.3463", "-1.0482353", "-0.4761276", "1.0888611", "-0.8222141", "0.7835975", "-1.9091854", "2.2892709", "-1.0751019", "-0.7093224", "0.25555164", "0.5806611", "-0.1323132", "0.32013655", "0.029879823", "0.6352598", "-0.62364006", "-0.30191916", "0.39606133", "-0.76300555", "0.47733513", "-0.17437443", "-1.3835839", "-0.59205216", "-3.3747532", "0.9947298", "0.5113317", "0.25785613", "-1.9669788", "0.48043346", "1.4345216", "0.7094217", "0.18224977", "-0.0583803", "-0.6815646", "-0.7652825", "0.014250077", "-0.50367373", "1.2470042", "-0.9023973", "-0.87331015", "0.54952055", "-1.5021881", "0.93927866", "-1.2387313", "0.41688076", "-1.9665239", "-0.2586132", "0.592737", "0.57070994", "0.41860944", "-0.8564864", "-0.54067844", "-0.65865505", "0.7605548", "-0.9468933", "-0.29188234", "1.5099907", "-0.27972504", "0.84137166", "0.5934054", "1.5445604", "0.16873878", "-0.80807084", "-1.2950474", "-0.6433429", "0.23163088", "-0.113746665", "-0.18552817", "-0.57686543", "0.16040552", "-2.22914", "-1.6647677", "1.059232", "-1.0186377", "3.247538", "0.32231742", "0.10700028", "0.08361134", "1.2317985", "-0.13991149", "2.033893", "0.39603764", "0.5916747", "0.21584634", "3.0917015", "-0.9068557", "0.26935735", "-0.4978758", "1.9216079", "1.3176863", "2.4813585", "-0.14642094", "0.65773296", "2.3428664", "0.004110636", "0.8403103", "-1.6884009", "-1.1126204", "-0.5860127", "0.8276291"]}
