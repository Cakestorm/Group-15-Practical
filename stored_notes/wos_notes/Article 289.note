{"body": "BACKGROUND The time of progression towards AIDS can vary greatly among seropositive patients, and may be associated with host genetic variation. The NR1I2 (PXR) gene, a ligand-activated transcription factor, regulates the transcription immune pathway genes and can therefore be targets of viral replication mechanisms influencing time of progression to AIDS. OBJECTIVE To verify the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs3814057, rs6785049, rs7643645, and rs2461817 in the NR1I2 (PXR) gene with progression to AIDS in HIV-1 infected patients. METHODS Blood samples were obtained from 96 HIV-1 positive individuals following informed consent. DNA was isolated and genotyped through real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the presence of SNPs in the NR1I2. Questionnaires on socio-demographic features and behaviors were answered and time of progression to AIDS was estimated based on medical chart analysis. FINDINGS Patients with the GG genotype for rs7643645 were shown to be related with a more rapid disease progression when compared to GA and AA genotypes. This result was maintained by the Multivariate Cox Regression considering sex, ethnicity, and presence of HLA-B*57, HLA-B*27, and CCR5del32 polymorphisms. MAIN CONCLUSIONS Recent studies reported the expression of the nuclear receptors in T-Lymphocytes, suggesting their possible role in the immune response. In addition, nuclear receptors have been shown to inhibit the HIV replication, although no such mechanism has been thoroughly elucidated to date. This is the first time an association between NR1I2 polymorphism and time of progression to AIDS is reported and supports an apparent relationship between the gene in the immune response and identifies another genetic factor influencing AIDS progression.\n", "embeddings": ["0.55079246", "-0.95973015", "-0.9924119", "-0.5542827", "-0.024399824", "-0.42314696", "0.39624187", "0.52428764", "-0.47263128", "-0.43819317", "-0.68417996", "-0.5020786", "1.375996", "-0.3770299", "-1.2063768", "-0.47518593", "-0.960372", "1.1608683", "0.23411864", "-2.3325007", "-0.3284599", "1.0018675", "0.9263373", "-0.32580698", "-0.0022042324", "0.8107938", "0.0045105857", "-0.16856468", "-0.165662", "0.39664388", "1.2474021", "-0.49605843", "-0.52456224", "-1.2351118", "-0.9682017", "0.3671059", "0.6497125", "-0.052792132", "1.6481918", "-0.50205237", "0.22360212", "0.33242208", "-0.24004994", "-1.0861099", "-0.99462336", "-1.3010471", "-0.84372556", "-1.5487747", "-0.745042", "0.07085074", "-1.0186094", "-0.31113437", "-0.9103097", "1.1289378", "-0.2737584", "-1.2647086", "-0.02717457", "-1.4916427", "0.2425293", "0.39518052", "1.379095", "-0.18025684", "-0.89683104", "0.3355215", "-2.1596158", "1.4619373", "-0.90729016", "1.4461341", "0.41392285", "0.6815683", "0.48622376", "0.061288428", "1.1257763", "-0.14003576", "0.99752164", "-1.5980284", "-0.46104494", "0.089710385", "0.29015285", "1.4602534", "-1.4190415", "-0.98627", "1.126711", "-0.1845935", "0.27195394", "0.070487835", "-0.42320028", "-0.07158921", "-0.47306898", "-1.7140754", "1.0784637", "2.249495", "0.14820154", "-0.92945045", "0.008903541", "-0.23724541", "0.1494034", "0.26782578", "-0.31219456", "-0.70783156", "0.40373653", "1.8031179", "-0.064851426", "-0.28601122", "-0.06341362", "-0.83292395", "-0.9005158", "0.55868644", "0.5392522", "-0.40435153", "-0.42796212", "-2.1894085", "0.9604444", "0.29317197", "-0.4141771", "-1.1765743", "0.87698436", "-1.0254645", "-0.48265445", "-0.79130834", "-0.08052874", "0.20916492", "1.5074084", "-0.027957372", "-1.2525096", "-0.8849589", "-0.82330877", "0.17061497", "-0.08306067", "0.37052545", "1.8331267", "-0.30839357", "-0.8732306", "-0.96946114", "-1.6252639", "0.40467253", "0.094435476", "0.59908783", "0.20636377", "-2.738428", "0.11345592", "0.39342424", "0.34199032", "1.0905136", "-0.7198147", "-1.5005606", "-0.05814727", "-0.1065467", "-1.4845525", "0.5081829", "1.224065", "1.876596", "-0.29338074", "1.0773144", "-0.73496956", "0.5379263", "1.5384337", "1.008837", "-0.62091583", "-0.051540926", "0.7351153", "0.32595176", "0.07576533", "-0.41367453", "-1.692562", "1.7553239", "0.7040893", "0.38776538", "-0.10339239", "0.41812572", "0.26566857", "1.3353561", "-0.7863527", "-0.5752689", "1.1299821", "-1.4514427", "0.20156306", "0.6592871", "0.7286485", "0.7008023", "-0.24062793", "0.91870743", "-0.0445974", "0.35052463", "0.2756694", "-0.5412531", "-1.6044949", "0.25272527", "0.74911034", "-0.23214899", "0.7620039", "-1.5678283", "-0.5556759", "0.17471962", "0.052038345", "1.7528201", "1.1942804", "-1.4954808", "-0.242994", "-0.8590068"]}
