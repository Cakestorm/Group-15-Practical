{"title": "Article 2565", "body": "Objectives: Physical activity may have positive effects on decreasing anxiety, stress and depression, maintaining mental health and ensuring psychological vitality. This study aimed to determine how a \"Physical Activity Program\" for elderly people in nursing homes affected their depressive symptoms and quality of life. Methods: We included 80 individuals aged >65 years (40 in the intervention group, 40 controls) in this experimental, randomized, controlled pretest-posttest study. Besides socio-demographic data, depressive symptoms and quality of life were assessed by standardized procedures (Beck Depression Scale [BDI], SF 36 Quality of Life Questionnaire) before and after a ten-weeks lasting \"Physical Activity Program\", consisting of 10 min warm-up activities, 20 mintes rhythmic exercices, 10 min cool-down exercises and a 30 mintes free walking period on four days of the week. Results: In contast to controls, individuals of the intervention group presented with a significant decrease in the BDI after the \"Physical Activity Program\". Likewise, eight-subscales and two sub-dimensions of the SF 36 Quality of Life Questionnaire significantly improved only in the experimental group (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Our results suggest that a structured physical activity program positively impacts depressive symptoms and quality of life in elderly individuals. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.
