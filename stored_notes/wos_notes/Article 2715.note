{"body": "Background: Germline mutations of the REarranged during Transfection (RET) proto-oncogene cause multiple endocrine neoplasia 2 (MEN2). It is unclear whether the distribution of RET mutations varies among populations. The first nationwide study of the distribution of RET mutations was conducted, and the results were compared to those of other populations. Methods: This retrospective cohort study included 1583 patients who underwent RET gene testing in one of three centers covering all of Denmark between September 1994 and December 2014. Primary testing method was Sanger sequencing, which included exons 8-11 and 13-16. Mutations were defined according to the ARUP database July 1, 2016. Results: RET mutations were identified in 163 patients from 36 apparently unrelated families. Among the 36 families 13 (36.1%) carried mutations in codon 611, four (11.1%) in codon 618, three (8.3%) in codon 620, one (2.8%) in codon 631, six (16.7%) in codon 634, one (2.8%) in codon 790, one (2.8%) in codon 804, one (2.8%) in codon 852, one (2.8%) in codon 883, and five (13.9%) in codon 918. Among the 13 families with codon 611 mutations, 12 had the p. C611Y mutation. Conclusions: The distribution of RET mutations in Denmark appears to differ from that of other populations. Mutations in codon 611 were the most prevalent, followed by more frequently reported mutations. This might be due to a possible founder effect for the p. C611Y mutation. However, further studies are needed to find possible explanations for the skewed mutational spectrum in Denmark.\n", "embeddings": ["0.13747394", "0.96959245", "0.3701425", "0.2502415", "0.2831172", "0.4630475", "1.6423286", "-0.3435135", "-0.6226828", "-0.88843185", "-0.08304116", "-1.5827435", "0.2311262", "-3.1149802", "0.35990444", "-0.3903155", "0.6266914", "1.0452818", "0.15146923", "-3.056873", "-0.59959984", "-0.89725924", "0.74168414", "0.785712", "-1.131169", "-0.69213104", "-0.42685664", "-0.22928053", "-0.76236045", "-0.45529723", "-0.17849247", "0.03931011", "-0.10494645", "0.35346565", "0.27304786", "0.7897177", "0.02728361", "-0.102591135", "0.69578815", "-0.98771685", "-0.2718157", "0.5722605", "-0.43646637", "0.10451982", "1.2071873", "-1.0197033", "0.27790377", "-1.957978", "0.60176766", "-0.47408226", "0.10892348", "-0.8369514", "-0.97878027", "0.19749875", "1.3262498", "0.56934476", "0.2907918", "-1.3457835", "-0.25265852", "0.90664405", "0.78800505", "0.33718473", "0.38959292", "0.49976367", "-1.6272339", "1.6549829", "1.1957504", "1.5217948", "0.27793548", "-0.11391681", "0.4107373", "-0.05849106", "0.5596163", "1.4259688", "1.0851213", "-0.5058272", "1.0898226", "-1.10334", "-0.2161952", "0.33053634", "-0.1336071", "-1.2722912", "1.0915105", "0.008662586", "0.1521567", "0.09561707", "0.33822393", "0.38993356", "0.87860805", "-0.48406845", "0.8557779", "0.9579129", "1.1253768", "0.8986285", "1.0091536", "-0.37556264", "0.4559269", "0.68399394", "-0.5423551", "-0.31149426", "-0.037915077", "0.22366437", "0.7895414", "0.6471493", "0.18205898", "0.118835814", "-0.26304874", "1.2530578", "-1.2879113", "-0.6415957", "0.24957103", "-1.3906196", "0.49348027", "0.02691362", "1.5457854", "-0.28760853", "-0.47409275", "-2.1588926", "-0.16346222", "-0.84617317", "-0.7759495", "-0.52559435", "1.5993171", "-1.3521726", "-0.09390766", "1.0660849", "-0.3632825", "-0.13801423", "1.3891183", "-0.66339016", "1.002999", "0.38456345", "-0.3169648", "-0.21615972", "-2.8600674", "1.9860443", "-0.94089454", "-0.1244393", "-1.2367421", "-2.7107837", "-0.4078268", "0.011742705", "0.80841416", "-0.33556148", "-0.44525415", "0.17752694", "0.2613349", "0.32153788", "-0.805729", "0.38422084", "-0.9429362", "0.8416906", "-0.29727393", "-0.37508073", "-1.0610566", "2.1699386", "-0.91295403", "0.85102606", "-0.8954858", "-0.51188874", "1.0138468", "1.1021649", "1.0917511", "0.4639442", "0.069211796", "2.7395234", "1.4615039", "-0.89677525", "-0.5131697", "1.0707545", "-0.13411555", "-0.27750102", "-0.0715349", "0.64975137", "-0.14190713", "0.081614345", "-1.1152719", "1.5823265", "1.1040789", "0.13795456", "-1.6940106", "0.4355283", "0.06935771", "0.31094182", "-0.22019176", "-1.1839647", "-0.7481997", "-0.22099859", "1.6041921", "-0.44533107", "0.29629683", "-0.512735", "-0.0042498615", "-0.33784443", "-0.21964355", "0.37883824", "0.5253393", "-0.2917311", "-0.91554666", "-0.17886907"]}
