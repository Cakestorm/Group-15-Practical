{"body": "Background: Many microRNAs (miRNAs) have recently been shown to demonstrate critical roles in differentiation, proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Methods and Results: In this study, a certain amount of miRNA expression in VSMCs was evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction, and it was found that microRNA-30e (miR-30e) was expressed more strongly than other common vascular well-expressed miRNAs in vitro. Subsequently, both a gain and loss of function study was performed in vitro and in vivo. It was found that miR-30e in VSMCs was strongly downregulated concomitantly with stimulation, and miR-30e inhibited VSMCs proliferation and migration both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2I (Ube2i) was identified as the target gene of endogenous miR-30e by luciferase reporter assay, and it was confirmed that overexpression of miR-30e significantly reduced Ube2i and inhibited the phenotypic switch of VSMCs. Knockdown of Ube2i had an influence over the proliferation and migration of cultured VSMCs, as same as the miR-30e mimic did. Overexpression of miR-30e induced the apoptosis of VSMCs and deregulated the protein expression of IkBa, which is crucial for the NF.B signal pathway. Conclusions: The results of this study indicated that miR-30e in VSMCs exerted an anti-atherosclerosis effect via inhibiting proliferation and migration, and promoting apoptosis of VSMCs. More specifically, it was demonstrated that miR-30e exhibited these effects on VSMCs partially through targeting Ube2i and downregulating the I kappa Ba/NF kappa B signaling pathway.\n", "embeddings": ["0.54637057", "0.55042154", "-1.4896791", "-0.40590218", "0.32172862", "0.5303798", "1.2409644", "0.017163604", "0.6323195", "0.68382555", "-0.2248529", "-0.22969957", "-0.5202856", "0.9661196", "-1.474908", "0.8115021", "1.187128", "-0.49891034", "0.43037045", "-2.618332", "0.7975627", "-0.7592463", "-0.14680709", "-0.12691541", "-0.26313907", "-0.7705715", "0.11230181", "0.26607722", "-0.32661211", "0.10318157", "1.9148601", "-0.025034742", "0.17734636", "-1.2758422", "-1.3028345", "0.13560382", "1.0357476", "-0.5958643", "-0.52904475", "0.7054365", "-0.47599065", "-0.2877629", "-1.3395805", "0.24562363", "1.7758982", "0.22759734", "-0.5081542", "-0.66524166", "1.9402245", "1.7045763", "0.512685", "-2.6747172", "0.9944825", "-0.16986035", "-0.66620904", "0.96644944", "-0.8912459", "0.21792059", "-1.090396", "0.68067425", "-0.5878315", "1.6884506", "0.79550713", "0.9443342", "0.12864038", "1.3274347", "0.28863305", "0.37369475", "0.11864392", "0.84412724", "-0.95962733", "0.9738389", "0.32980525", "0.5416634", "0.41282862", "-0.17949162", "1.2754894", "-1.640861", "-0.021711841", "-0.45517293", "0.5132337", "-1.9972291", "-1.461774", "1.2252653", "-2.1079192", "0.50405985", "1.3295764", "0.39923403", "-0.53458637", "0.15288934", "-0.42164", "-0.03773213", "1.5098553", "-1.0827127", "-0.24440528", "-0.8255809", "0.1492934", "-1.158562", "-0.8785001", "0.6944797", "-0.88864446", "1.4980893", "0.7991605", "0.24508028", "0.6865932", "0.64769316", "-0.32227322", "-0.16441038", "-0.47673386", "0.3222113", "-1.279101", "-0.72264695", "-0.2862578", "0.58572924", "-0.49353912", "-1.7576882", "-0.43414372", "-1.1703217", "-0.25551215", "-1.4045681", "-0.83989316", "0.38925645", "0.22761708", "0.4450421", "1.0753862", "0.49673617", "-0.079536974", "-1.6490327", "0.7883788", "-0.89488506", "1.0275977", "-0.6668773", "0.24404687", "0.41790876", "-0.82937694", "0.5629087", "-0.64320123", "0.063728385", "0.59870696", "0.26061988", "1.3997766", "-0.604663", "-0.04736138", "0.61149853", "0.90184057", "0.8138965", "-0.45142543", "-1.0738567", "-1.1606916", "0.87039995", "-1.1162882", "-0.8291358", "0.07249715", "0.8430786", "-0.7422141", "0.34317786", "0.4832668", "0.9923948", "0.5464659", "-0.43570846", "0.94427407", "0.5099893", "1.2068402", "0.02780198", "0.19170015", "-0.1639476", "1.4543935", "0.34606567", "-1.1385618", "0.58117956", "-0.09426002", "0.71141326", "0.8065146", "-0.04311878", "0.75122285", "-1.7458642", "-0.11444348", "-0.6243099", "-0.14734653", "0.037614703", "-0.8596615", "0.94693744", "-0.40610704", "-0.5447359", "0.11104597", "-1.3263092", "0.65017205", "0.2213613", "1.8253219", "0.3759807", "0.07817712", "1.3084948", "0.04736403", "1.5540528", "-1.5084469", "-0.032233655", "-0.47695616", "-0.9981016", "-0.7019369", "-0.5148633"]}
