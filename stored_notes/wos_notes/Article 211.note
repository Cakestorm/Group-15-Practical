The primary finding was that the amount of time spent on the Internet and on SNSs was significantly higher among depressed adolescents than non-depressed adolescents. Additionally, depressed adolescents reported significantly higher disclosure of anhedonia, worthlessness, guilt, loss of concentration, irritability and thoughts of suicide on SNSs. The intensity of the depression sharing was significantly higher in the depressed group. Depressed young people use social networks to express their symptoms.
