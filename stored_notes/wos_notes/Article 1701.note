We assessed the associations of chronotype with health status in the general Finnish adult population. Our population-based data were derived from the National FINRISK 2012 study and consisted of 4414 participants, aged 25-74 years, living in Finland. As part of their health examination, participants were asked about their circadian preference to the daily activities (morningness-eveningness) and a diagnosis or treatment for a set of common noncommunicable medical conditions and chronic diseases during the past 12 months. We found that there were 1935 (43.8%) morning types (MTs) and 595 (13.5%) evening types (ETs) and that 1884 (42.7%) were intermediates. As compared with the MTs, the ETs had significantly greater odds for depression (OR = 2.44, 95% CI = 1.52-3.90, p < 0.001) and other mental disorders (OR = 5.18, 95% CI = 2.32-11.52, p < 0.001). The odds were also increased for gallstones, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, but these did not remain significant after controlling for multiple testing. Responses to the single-item subjective estimation on the chronotype yielded the association of the definitely evening type of persons with the diagnosis or treatment of cardiac insufficiency (OR = 1.99, 95% CI = 1.02-3.88, p = 0.044) that was corroborated as the greater the eveningness score was, the more common the diagnosis or treatment of cardiac insufficiency was (beta= 0.92, 95% CI = 0.85-0.98, p = 0.013). This exploratory study adds further support to the role of evening chronotype in chronic disease risk, albeit underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated.\n"}]}, "text": "Chronotype is an emerging predictor of health and longevity, and understanding its influence on chronic diseases is important for constructing conceptual models of long-term pathways to health.
