{"body": "Chronotype is an emerging predictor of health and longevity, and understanding its influence on chronic diseases is important for constructing conceptual models of long-term pathways to health. We assessed the associations of chronotype with health status in the general Finnish adult population. Our population-based data were derived from the National FINRISK 2012 study and consisted of 4414 participants, aged 25-74 years, living in Finland. As part of their health examination, participants were asked about their circadian preference to the daily activities (morningness-eveningness) and a diagnosis or treatment for a set of common noncommunicable medical conditions and chronic diseases during the past 12 months. We found that there were 1935 (43.8%) morning types (MTs) and 595 (13.5%) evening types (ETs) and that 1884 (42.7%) were intermediates. As compared with the MTs, the ETs had significantly greater odds for depression (OR = 2.44, 95% CI = 1.52-3.90, p < 0.001) and other mental disorders (OR = 5.18, 95% CI = 2.32-11.52, p < 0.001). The odds were also increased for gallstones, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, but these did not remain significant after controlling for multiple testing. Responses to the single-item subjective estimation on the chronotype yielded the association of the definitely evening type of persons with the diagnosis or treatment of cardiac insufficiency (OR = 1.99, 95% CI = 1.02-3.88, p = 0.044) that was corroborated as the greater the eveningness score was, the more common the diagnosis or treatment of cardiac insufficiency was (beta= 0.92, 95% CI = 0.85-0.98, p = 0.013). This exploratory study adds further support to the role of evening chronotype in chronic disease risk, albeit underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated.\n", "embeddings": ["-0.07972784", "-0.42012984", "0.8099094", "0.095512286", "0.40396348", "-2.3786502", "-0.2090904", "0.9776227", "-0.9866054", "0.5365712", "-0.2000037", "0.24299027", "0.39607963", "0.15220554", "-1.2062805", "-0.0014457352", "0.66655815", "-0.21652332", "-0.74765396", "-1.4393516", "-0.2365796", "-0.49752474", "0.74522406", "0.47143325", "0.16723318", "0.13450319", "-0.35345766", "-1.9268552", "-1.6362692", "0.62585706", "0.8913284", "1.2973338", "0.75409114", "-0.8537566", "0.3084419", "1.2442297", "-0.5802878", "-1.3362694", "-0.096514456", "0.78633976", "-1.244779", "0.49731028", "0.6790229", "-1.1170857", "0.036921684", "-0.6103095", "-1.348626", "0.33940744", "0.25028569", "0.59191376", "1.6409259", "-0.8123229", "-0.6340231", "-0.1959725", "-0.7821157", "0.08090913", "-0.91667414", "0.73247236", "-0.8737543", "-0.36892658", "0.85453296", "0.7105719", "0.5509994", "-1.0936667", "0.7586912", "-0.2558183", "-0.74326277", "1.6012529", "1.906287", "0.7650341", "-0.53373194", "0.09273827", "-0.96482265", "0.77487695", "0.21094531", "1.4256136", "1.7406238", "-0.08980436", "-0.85891485", "-0.77673113", "-0.38620397", "0.61322355", "-1.5223191", "1.429958", "-0.59546226", "-0.7180198", "-0.18223637", "-0.48739713", "0.45477995", "-0.043905586", "0.4056159", "2.1435452", "0.117940746", "-0.4907349", "0.6246391", "0.37308836", "-0.20869134", "0.62389886", "0.7017827", "0.20034337", "0.7169643", "0.7514472", "-0.04912612", "-0.025520071", "0.6537386", "-1.7591399", "1.2361261", "1.2823751", "-1.7128478", "-0.73463565", "-0.7781986", "-1.9892142", "0.20397338", "-0.81156975", "-0.45673195", "-1.0743816", "-1.5286723e-05", "-0.25726503", "0.51210296", "-1.3366948", "-0.28086078", "0.40640375", "0.6957819", "-0.476076", "-0.038139075", "-0.13183822", "0.37950262", "0.51249987", "0.6751803", "0.33686274", "2.4432306", "-0.56683964", "-0.8136677", "-1.3182867", "-0.40454018", "0.61684686", "-0.64731854", "-0.52912503", "0.020834463", "-1.6858279", "-0.8887078", "-1.1171582", "-0.050738186", "0.1506719", "1.117009", "1.1180937", "0.68860334", "0.63906014", "-0.43683508", "0.013696567", "-0.7618384", "0.20712024", "-0.83848906", "1.6696874", "-1.6578597", "0.397085", "1.5097548", "0.074811995", "0.6968631", "-0.25696075", "0.41276315", "0.30947238", "0.48481393", "-0.4825068", "-0.3906318", "0.14009634", "-0.493408", "0.9176385", "0.40821886", "-0.010001874", "0.64745134", "-0.08217146", "-0.94322115", "0.492133", "0.09063491", "0.103202544", "-0.31217772", "0.30522633", "0.046098053", "-0.44245654", "-1.2392625", "-0.6567774", "-1.8023845", "-0.030542934", "-0.8524633", "0.8090334", "0.042333804", "1.1173072", "-1.4459848", "-0.6583362", "1.0524402", "-0.71521115", "-0.6634274", "-1.015532", "-0.19051206", "-0.34958133", "0.035042092", "0.019607676", "-0.38746366", "-0.8920182"]}
