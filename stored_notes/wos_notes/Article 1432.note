Between August 2007 and August 2011, 176 patients with cervical carcinoma were enrolled as the case group, and 180 healthy individuals were selected as the control group. elF3a Arg803Lys C >T genotypes were detected by hemi-nested polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism. All patients received chemoradiotherapy and were evaluated for efficacy. Compared with carriers of the CC genotype, carriers of the T genotype of the elF3a Arg803Lys C >T polymorphism had a higher risk of cervical carcinoma. The elF3a Arg803Lys C >T polymorphism was associated with tumor size, differentiation degree, Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage, and lymph node metastasis (LNM). The overall response rate of the case group was 69.32% (122/176). The response rate of CC genotype carriers was higher compared to patients with the CM+TT genotypes. Binary-logistic regression analysis showed that tumor size, FIGO stage, LNM, and the e1F3a Arg803Lys C >T polymorphism were influencing factors for chemoradiotherapy efficacy. Univariate analysis revealed that age, e1F3a Arg803Lys C >T polymorphism, differentiation degree, FIGO stage, and LNM were prognostic factors of cervical carcinoma, and multivariate analysis showed that age >= 60 years, higher FIGO stage, and LNM, as well as the CT and TT genotypes of the elF3a Arg803Lys C >T polymorphism, were risk factors related to the prognosis of cervical carcinoma. The e1F3a Arg803Lys C >T polymorphism is connected with a higher susceptibility to cervical carcinoma and may affect chemoradiotherapy efficacy in and prognosis of cervical carcinoma.
