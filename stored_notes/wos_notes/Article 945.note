In this work, its stereoselective degradation was investigated in plants and domesticated active sludge.

The microbial community that was responsible for BF-biodegrading in active sludge was studied by polymerase chain reaction and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE). In plant researches, chiral difference was discovered in the degradation of pesticides that onions resulted in. The existence of gothite in soil not only reduced the amount of BF that plants uptake from the environment, but it also enlarged the chiral difference during the process, indicating that the absorption of gothite to pesticides had enantioselectivity, which may be generated by that adsorption site where BF combined with gothite located in the chiral center of the pesticide. In studies of sludge, BF can be effectively degraded and decline of both isomers followed first-order kinetics. However, there was no obvious stereoselective degradation in domesticated sludge. The analysis of DGGE revealed that active sludge maintained the rich microbial community in the whole process (H >3). The H index increased in the early domestication, which may because BF had no direct toxicity to the bacteria.
