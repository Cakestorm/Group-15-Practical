{"body": "Background: Recent studies suggest that immunotherapy using T regulatory cells (Tregs) prolongs remission in type 1 diabetes (T1DM). Here, we report factors that possibly affect the efficacy of this treatment. Methods: The metabolic and immune background of 12 children with recently diagnosed T1DM, as well as that of untreated subjects, during a 2-year follow-up is presented. Patients were treated with up to 30 x 10(6)/kg b.w. of autologous expanded CD3(+)CD4(+)CD25(high)CD127(-)Tregs. Results: The disease progressed and all patients were insulin-dependent 2 years after inclusion. The beta-cell function measured by c-peptide levels and the use of insulin were the best preserved in patients treated with two doses of Tregs (3/6 in remission), less so after one dose (1/6 in remission) and the worst in untreated controls (no remissions). Increased levels of Tregs could be seen in peripheral blood after their adoptive transfer together with the shift from naive CD62L(+)CD45RA(+) to memory CD62L(+)CD45RA(-)Tregs. Increasing serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines were found: IL6 increased in all subjects, while IL1 and TNF alpha increased only in untreated group. Therapeutic Tregs were dependent on IL2, and their survival could be improved by other lymphocytes. Conclusions: The disease progression was associated with changing proportions of naive and memory Tregs and slowly increasing proinflammatory activity, which was only partially controlled by the administered Tregs. The therapeutic cells were highly dependent on IL2. We conclude that the therapy should be administered at the earliest to protect the highest possible mass of islets and also to utilize the preserved content of Tregs in the earlier phases of T1DM.\n", "embeddings": ["0.22605705", "0.8078518", "-1.2108111", "-0.85460967", "0.11425706", "0.60486925", "-1.5388249", "1.0841441", "-0.044270575", "0.23922122", "-2.5464075", "-0.22477852", "0.6604775", "0.453561", "-2.3642101", "1.8660394", "0.19777097", "-0.07139899", "-0.047631525", "-0.47702897", "0.53879", "-0.8051078", "0.32104582", "0.087984696", "0.3504538", "-0.58719134", "2.0682623", "-0.05478712", "-1.1219525", "-0.9078252", "0.9139005", "1.6783671", "2.0574439", "-0.07380254", "0.8785804", "1.5568362", "-0.32907763", "0.036790147", "0.36542666", "-0.6551726", "-0.98051715", "0.29908827", "-0.16283181", "0.91034675", "-0.7880536", "0.15669002", "1.4384483", "-0.43271437", "-1.8047751", "-0.47878936", "0.29746687", "-0.9391323", "-0.3945842", "0.9321305", "0.29460967", "-0.24601147", "-1.2245216", "-1.6038803", "-1.0049369", "0.0636466", "-1.1476712", "0.5897252", "-1.1929128", "0.3262454", "-0.4075016", "-0.5087182", "1.8395257", "0.7839677", "-1.8916562", "0.64442116", "0.417173", "2.2079892", "-1.0888004", "0.83369684", "0.284766", "0.38412488", "0.045723137", "0.019242296", "-0.6324883", "1.0114344", "0.18085527", "-0.13380344", "0.63757145", "1.2302532", "-0.6978541", "0.025354357", "0.35044125", "-0.12079799", "-0.2808297", "0.035165288", "2.284384", "1.2552131", "0.5276624", "1.4624507", "0.77740836", "0.40400916", "0.08856938", "0.6201374", "-0.5642362", "1.2127115", "-2.0036452", "-0.79717124", "0.072202675", "0.72804654", "-2.5489693", "-0.9570654", "1.0898311", "0.6233378", "-1.0361322", "-0.9634951", "0.56645536", "-0.96209383", "-1.480302", "0.3119122", "0.88971424", "-2.4337888", "-0.1898806", "-0.8927095", "-2.033085", "-0.056286305", "-1.1705446", "-0.6476758", "1.224563", "-0.9666244", "0.72977936", "0.049781155", "0.6908259", "-0.63562304", "-0.65821815", "-1.3533359", "-0.4393902", "-0.34237716", "-1.2871441", "-0.484107", "0.2919652", "0.60959905", "-1.5962721", "1.7999564", "-3.3145761", "-0.40363544", "-0.032090075", "-1.0867939", "0.55115366", "-0.25832853", "0.42901084", "1.0882909", "0.59352195", "0.6446694", "-0.639323", "0.8964145", "0.7689621", "-0.093411066", "0.13657223", "0.35804933", "-0.64945805", "0.22255136", "1.9485705", "1.4230932", "-0.007842013", "0.08626983", "-0.034872334", "0.5175906", "-1.376681", "0.98318315", "-1.549847", "0.8592832", "1.1706756", "0.61423624", "-1.7557541", "0.439866", "0.21493796", "0.38778597", "-0.7199142", "1.016861", "0.5770648", "-0.7459509", "-0.5654292", "0.8695357", "-1.0998302", "0.40995288", "0.70336586", "-0.45910615", "-0.9370599", "-0.2399469", "0.017651483", "-2.6139894", "-0.39816973", "-0.89217645", "1.5002166", "-0.29841885", "2.325447", "1.3564299", "-1.1138657", "-1.115915", "-0.2805471", "1.0776626", "-0.5357385", "0.47453812", "0.6682633", "-0.85797894"]}
