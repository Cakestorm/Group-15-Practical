It demonstrates the optimization on several case studies inspired by Singapore & the Middle East. It concludes that renewable energy simultaneously reduces CO2 emissions and water withdrawals. Furthermore, it shows how water storage can help alleviate binding co-production constraints, flatten production profiles and reduce production cost levels. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
