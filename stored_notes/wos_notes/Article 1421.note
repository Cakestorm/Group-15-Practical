{"body": "Projection neurons play a key role in carrying long-distance information between spatially distant areas of the nervous system and in controlling motor circuits. Little is known about how projection neurons with distinct anatomical targets are organized, and few studies have addressed their spatial organization at the level of individual cells. In the paired commissural ganglia (CoGs) of the stomatogastric nervous system of the crab Cancer borealis, projection neurons convey sensory, motor, and modulatory information to several distinct anatomical regions. While the functions of descending projection neurons (dPNs) which control downstream motor circuits in the stomatogastric ganglion are well characterized, their anatomical distribution as well as that of neurons projecting to the labrum, brain, and thoracic ganglion have received less attention. Using cell membrane staining, we investigated the spatial distribution of CoG projection neurons in relation to all CoG neurons. Retrograde tracing revealed that somata associated with different axonal projection pathways were not completely spatially segregated, but had distinct preferences within the ganglion. Identified dPNs had diameters larger than 70% of CoG somata and were restricted to the most medial and anterior 25% of the ganglion. They were contained within a cluster of motor neurons projecting through the same nerve to innervate the labrum, indicating that soma position was independent of function and target area. Rather, our findings suggest that CoG neurons projecting to a variety of locations follow a generalized rule: for all nerve pathway origins, the soma cluster centroids in closest proximity are those whose axons project down that pathway.\n", "embeddings": ["2.5408835", "-0.09122805", "-0.7981858", "-1.2821692", "1.2104446", "-1.6220838", "-1.5281776", "1.1678321", "0.6035202", "1.7267365", "0.71911675", "0.114317074", "-1.2769169", "-0.24295571", "-2.187884", "-0.043870162", "0.86994904", "-2.2310233", "-0.18476842", "-1.8274273", "2.072574", "-0.2011779", "0.3539209", "0.17066106", "0.69939286", "-2.567523", "-2.32662", "-2.359425", "-1.1890852", "0.13396169", "0.80450785", "0.6402168", "0.7907064", "0.18945658", "-0.92515755", "-0.07530353", "-0.01310206", "0.18215108", "0.24025531", "-0.3046031", "-1.7064754", "-0.53385484", "-0.25308195", "-1.7216203", "0.26201567", "-0.50840545", "-1.0534766", "0.11887565", "-0.09591563", "1.2733625", "-1.3297046", "0.8804107", "-0.900471", "-0.45305094", "-0.43034598", "1.1299301", "1.1648163", "0.5212061", "-0.36448807", "-0.64938736", "-0.22449787", "0.76797044", "-0.8062707", "0.8341748", "-0.7358941", "1.5307895", "0.9966989", "-0.11231083", "-0.37119365", "-1.6812457", "-0.47258186", "-1.0523105", "0.88049537", "1.305688", "0.16439183", "-1.0678544", "0.8820872", "-0.96428084", "-1.0511689", "-2.590252", "-1.6564959", "-1.9101433", "0.27552646", "0.18873559", "-1.7383155", "0.910899", "1.2015823", "-1.4795623", "0.0911097", "-3.2819643", "0.8950104", "0.006887341", "0.8971289", "0.0017840927", "0.19407341", "-0.29900554", "0.09570118", "-0.32250842", "0.059746467", "-2.0601733", "-1.5534655", "-1.3564733", "0.72858346", "-1.4391537", "1.4220428", "-1.117003", "0.39662698", "-1.0922389", "0.9134595", "-1.693703", "1.3069485", "-1.4858301", "-0.20484373", "-0.6890809", "0.7681464", "-1.5781943", "1.097363", "-0.6845956", "-1.0482452", "-0.7527702", "0.6976086", "-0.20483874", "0.111161724", "-0.13197413", "0.69657224", "1.0799134", "-0.83779055", "0.5680884", "-0.019759584", "1.20793", "1.2062697", "1.0859951", "0.13827959", "-0.010924871", "1.3706796", "1.3009844", "-1.007704", "-1.2906133", "-1.2793313", "-0.14563362", "0.94762975", "-0.628106", "-1.868435", "-0.5992482", "1.0344169", "-1.1910654", "-2.00356", "-0.68974197", "-1.9399037", "0.72029597", "-0.52149695", "0.30622688", "-1.4520235", "0.099276856", "0.021000851", "-0.29929218", "1.0586658", "0.59414667", "-0.55581987", "1.1281245", "2.0048018", "-1.0663168", "-0.9478449", "0.695379", "-0.5614429", "-0.37950772", "2.6740522", "-1.1995531", "0.106510445", "1.4190308", "-0.17279956", "0.07929019", "-0.24871318", "0.7142018", "-1.4022207", "-0.7142403", "-0.85241723", "-0.9742283", "-1.6038641", "0.6975173", "-0.17145349", "-0.019619033", "1.8565563", "-0.26959875", "1.749896", "-0.27903914", "-1.1871766", "-1.3079141", "2.9643688", "0.49284568", "1.5936236", "0.61953527", "1.4715599", "-0.9994445", "0.2626002", "-0.011462126", "-1.9312825", "-0.67098385", "-1.2571782", "-0.5110206"]}
