{"body": "Intestinal subepithelial myofibroblasts (SEMFs) is a specific population of cells involved in intestinal inflammation and carcinogenesis via an elaborate network of cytokines, chemokines and other inflammatory factors, including PGE2. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) has been implicated as an important mediator of inflammation and cancer and in certain cell types increases cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression. In the present study, we aimed to assess involvement of S1P in COX-2 expression by SEMFs. Primary SEMFs were obtained from C57BL/6J mouse and their identity was verified by fluorescent staining of specific marker proteins. Expression of S1P receptors 1, 2, 3 and sphingosine kinases 1 and 2 in SEMFs were determined by RT-PCR analysis. COX-2 expression and PGE2 production were assayed by Western blotting and ELISA, respectively. COX-2 mRNA stability was assayed by Northern blotting. S1P produced dose-dependent increase in COX-2 expression, resulting in increased PGE2 release from SEMFs. Using specific inhibitors, we show that actions of p38, ERK, IKK, and PKC were involved in S1P-induced COX-2 expression. On the other hand, p38 and PKC had lesser roles in IL-1 beta-induced COX-2 expression. Inhibition of sphingosine kinase to block S1P production did not affect IL-1 beta-induced COX-2 expression, but S1P amplified IL-1 beta-induced p38 activation and COX-2 expression. PKC inhibition blocked S1P amplified COX-2 expression. S1P addition increased COX-2 mRNA stability. In SEMFs, S1P amplifies IL-1 beta-induced COX-2 expression through increased mRNA stability. These observations point to involvement of S1P in activation of SEMFs that may contribute to intestinal inflammation and carcinogenesis.\n", "embeddings": ["0.03698354", "0.9014716", "-0.9940824", "-1.7970426", "1.2765008", "-0.82217634", "-0.40656206", "1.9399866", "-0.30476126", "-0.27041847", "0.25549847", "-0.86958355", "-0.8423949", "0.24107422", "-1.9562631", "-0.6232227", "-0.05368603", "0.39439318", "-1.0259277", "-1.2048607", "0.6208169", "-1.788773", "-1.0119575", "-0.9865325", "-1.4997678", "-0.67379016", "-0.33103833", "0.9771178", "-1.1203263", "1.134869", "0.8900231", "1.4357271", "1.7597741", "-0.3580044", "0.4368392", "-0.8684524", "-0.036883", "0.36122438", "1.3745543", "-0.8654342", "-0.9243586", "-0.46343082", "0.7634186", "-0.91796076", "0.25496376", "0.6392524", "0.35676584", "-1.555675", "1.0920196", "-0.91206133", "1.2297739", "-0.0826058", "1.380512", "-1.1532358", "-0.31934127", "0.29839924", "-0.8854205", "-1.2064797", "-0.18977614", "1.0193993", "-0.39028034", "-0.41327378", "1.1094136", "-1.3753157", "-1.2252574", "0.02934817", "0.5972176", "0.81015956", "-0.9035788", "-1.1382905", "-0.43406934", "-0.017923025", "-0.18150227", "-1.0407671", "0.50660455", "0.285274", "1.1216218", "-0.10035741", "-1.1578909", "-0.07645789", "-1.1993989", "0.3873483", "-0.36730585", "0.65086013", "-0.059602033", "0.98942405", "0.9207966", "-0.5808107", "0.6411102", "0.6838963", "0.8852569", "0.40237898", "-0.36337548", "-0.3022483", "0.087189764", "-0.38257924", "1.2413155", "-1.0940226", "0.0465553", "0.096122645", "-0.1749213", "1.6249541", "1.1848736", "-0.5826136", "-1.468542", "-0.5668383", "-0.13487601", "0.97007304", "0.6281162", "-0.507961", "0.36089087", "-1.2915684", "1.1987318", "-1.2349885", "-0.63032633", "-1.2175907", "1.4205395", "0.5421161", "-0.036991708", "-0.6568492", "-0.8559498", "1.347603", "1.1018261", "-0.33520284", "1.639846", "1.9699037", "0.12583554", "-1.2172827", "-0.25567037", "0.5166783", "1.3341299", "-1.2224389", "0.23181944", "-0.46693313", "0.33144265", "1.2417117", "-0.06869414", "0.12594526", "-0.58284044", "-1.3579512", "-0.4683125", "0.13079615", "0.5654612", "-0.4004638", "0.6385308", "-0.09231755", "0.09602603", "-0.6010431", "-0.74091625", "2.2756295", "0.40152702", "-0.24740668", "-1.0904377", "0.84259784", "-0.6895436", "0.6739121", "-0.6296204", "0.6246505", "-0.26227397", "-0.4477548", "1.2222241", "0.12176737", "-0.3659648", "-0.39491406", "0.18096885", "2.372987", "-0.124444164", "-0.07147168", "-0.38668424", "-0.69845474", "-0.656306", "1.5502815", "-0.026431477", "0.18769795", "1.6688809", "-1.7523997", "0.5445897", "-0.2895141", "0.53184384", "-0.63637847", "0.25385383", "-0.2524135", "1.107676", "1.449132", "-0.08101986", "-0.014182132", "-1.0052946", "0.6095639", "-0.4439903", "-0.94800687", "0.6115965", "-0.25855944", "-0.7416716", "0.7410083", "0.87559336", "0.62733275", "0.62800276", "1.1209248", "-0.805245", "-0.28427175"]}
