{"title": "Article 1759", "body": "The aim of the study was to examine the relation between additional chromosomal aberrations (ACAs) with major molecular response (MMR) and BCR-ABL kinase domain (KD) mutations in the long-term follow-up of the chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) disease. The study design was cross-sectional observational and used the CML patients' data of Izmir Ataturk Education and Research Hospital from 2011 to 2015. Conventional cytogenetic, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) test results from 89 CML patients' and pyrosequencing analysis results from 17 patients' were set up for comparison analysis. The chi-square test was used in statistical analysis of the experimental data. There were no statistically significant correlations between ACAs and MMR (p=.361, p>.05) groups or BCR-ABL KD mutations (p=.576, p>.05) groups observed in the study. This study has revealed that MMR and BCR-ABL KD mutations did not correlate with ACAs.\n", "text": "The aim of the study was to examine the relation between additional chromosomal aberrations (ACAs) with major molecular response (MMR) and BCR-ABL kinase domain (KD) mutations in the long-term follow-up of the chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) disease.
