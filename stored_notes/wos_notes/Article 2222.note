{"title": "Article 2222", "body": "An upsurge of fever cases of unknown origin, but resembling dengue and leptospirosis was reported in Havelock, Andaman & Nicobar Islands, an important tourism spot, during May 2014. Investigations were carried out to determine the aetiology, and to describe the epidemiology of the outbreak. The data on fever cases attending Primary Health Centre (PHC), Havelock showed that the average number of cases reporting per week over the last 2 years was 461 (95% confidence interval 194-729). A total of 27 (435%) patients out of the 62 suspected cases were diagnosed as having DENV infection based on a positive enzyme immunoassay or reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. The overall attack rate was 94 cases/1000 population and it ranged between 28 and 188/1000 in different villages. The nucleotide sequencing showed that the virus responsible was DENV-3. DENV-3 was first detected in the Andaman & Nicobar Islands in 2013 among wharf workers in Port Blair and within a year it has spread to Havelock Island which is separated from South Andaman by 36 nautical miles.\n", "text": "An upsurge of fever cases of unknown origin, but resembling dengue and leptospirosis was reported in Havelock, Andaman & Nicobar Islands, an important tourism spot, during May 2014.
