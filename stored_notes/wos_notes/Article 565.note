These antibodies can be cytotoxic by activating the complement pathway via C1q and may cause organ rejection during the transplant. Some male patients awaiting kidney transplantation are seropositive for anti-HLA antibodies when they have no immunizing antecedent event. These antibodies are qualified as natural antibodies. Our work is to assess the cytotoxicity of natural anti-HLA antibodies in patients followed at the immunology laboratory of the blood transfusion service and hemovigilance (STSH) as part of the kidney transplant. Patients and methods. - We evaluated the cytotoxicity of HLA antibodies detected in male Moroccan patients without immunization history using C1q Screen One Lambda reagent for Luminex (TM) Results. - Non-immunized men were positive for HLA antibodies screening in 25.4%. These antibodies are not cytotoxic. Conclusion. - Our study showed a positivity rate of natural HLA antibody low than the literature (25.4% against 63%). It appears that these natural antibodies are not cytotoxic and their involvement in renal transplant remains to be determined. (C) 2016 Association Societe de nephrologie.
