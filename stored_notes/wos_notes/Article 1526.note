The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of childhood abuse and neglect in the general population living in Zonguldak province and the relationship between childhood trauma and suicidal ideations and attempts. MethodsThe present study was carried out with 897 people in the general population, as assessed in a representative sample from Zonguldak province. The cluster sampling method was used. After obtaining written consent from the people who agreed to participate in the study, the Socio-demographic Information Form, Suicide Probability Scale, Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, Beck Depression Inventory, and Beck Anxiety Inventory were administered. ResultsThe lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideations was 18.3% among those who experienced at least one type of early trauma, and it was 9.6% among those without a history of childhood trauma (P<0.001). Only emotional abuse exhibited a significantly high odds ratio for lifetime suicidal ideations (odds ratio [OR]=3.168, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.731-5.798) and attempts (OR=3.467, 95% CI=1.343-8.952). Emotional neglect showed a high odds ratio only for lifetime suicidal attempts (OR=3.282, 95% CI=1.287-8.371). There were significant correlations among the Beck Depression Inventory, Beck Anxiety Inventory, and Suicidal Probability Scale sub-scores and all six Childhood Trauma Questionnaire scores. DiscussionEmotional abuse and neglect in childhood are significantly associated with lifetime suicidal ideations and attempts in the general population living in Zonguldak province. Therefore, clinicians should be aware of the importance of the childhood trauma in the patients with suicidal ideations and attempts.\n"}]}, "text": "IntroductionNo previous study has investigated the association between early trauma and suicidal behavior in Zonguldak.
