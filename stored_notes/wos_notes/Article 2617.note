To investigate the nature and function of elongation factor 1 beta' from Spodoptera exigua (SeEF-1 beta'), its cDNA was cloned.

RT-PCR revealed that SeEF-1 beta' mRNA is expressed at different levels in fat body and whole body during different developmental stages. In RNAi experiments, the survival rate of insects injected with SeEF-1 beta' dsRNA was 58.7% at 36 h after injection, which was significantly lower than three control groups.
