{"title": "Article 930", "body": "Backgound: beta-Carotene exhibits biological activity as provitamin A. Key step in vitamin A formation is the cleavage of beta-carotene to retinal by an enzyme designated as beta-carotene 15,15'-monooxygenase (BCM). Recently, it is reported that expression of BCM gene in the intestine is under feedback regulation by retinoic acid (RA). However, the regulation of BCM gene expression in various other tissues is still unknown. Aim of the study: In the present study, we identified the full-length cDNA encoding the rat BCM gene and investigated the regulation of its expression in several tissues by RA in the presence of vitamin A deficiency. Methods: We cloned the full-length cDNA encoding BCM gene from a rat intestinal cDNA library by hybridization screening. The BCM gene expression was examined using Northern blotting and reverse transcription-PCR analysis. We also investigated whether BCM gene expression was regulated by retinoids in several tissues of vitamin A-deficient rats. Results: Sequence analysis of this clone revealed an open reading frame of 1,701 bases encoding a protein of 566 amino acids. The predicted polypeptide showed 94%, 81%, and 66% identity with mouse, human, and chicken BCM, respectively. Rat BCM mRNA was highly expressed in the intestine and liver, while there was weak expression in the testes, kidneys, and lungs. Immunoblotting revealed that rat BCM is a 64-kDa protein. BCM gene expression was increased in the small intestine by vitamin A deficiency compared with that in rats on a control diet, while this upregulation was suppressed by all-trans RA (ATRA) or 9-cis RA (9-cis RA). BCM gene expression in the lungs and testes was also suppressed by ATRA or 9-cis RA in rats with vitamin A deficiency. However, hepatic BCM gene expression was only decreased by ATRA and renal expression was not affected by either retinoid. As the small intestine is the major site of beta-carotene conversion, intestinal BCM gene expression may be more tightly regulated. Conclusion: These data suggest that BCM gene expression in several tissues may be down-regulated by RA at the level of conversion of beta-carotene to retinal. To prevent an excess of retinol, homeostasis may occur at the level of conversion of beta-carotene to retinal in several tissues.\n", "text": "Backgound: beta-Carotene exhibits biological activity as provitamin A.
