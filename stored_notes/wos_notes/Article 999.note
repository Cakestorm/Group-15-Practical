{"title": "Article 999", "body": "Eucheuma denticulatum, an economically and industrially important red alga, is a valuable marine resource. Although microRNAs (miRNAs) play an essential role in gene post-transcriptional regulation, no research has been conducted to identify and characterize miRNAs in E. denticulatum. In this study, we identified 134 miRNAs (133 conserved miRNAs and one novel miRNA) from 2,997,135 small-RNA reads by high-throughput sequencing combined with bioinformatics analysis. BLAST searching against miRBase uncovered 126 potential miRNA families. A conservation and diversity analysis of predicted miRNA families in different plant species was performed by comparative alignment and homology searching. A total of 4 and 13 randomly selected miRNAs were respectively validated by northern blotting and stem-loop reverse transcription PCR, thereby demonstrating the reliability of the miRNA sequencing data. Altogether, 871 potential target genes were predicted using psRobot and TargetFinder. Target genes classification and enrichment were conducted based on Gene Ontology analysis. The functions of target gene products and associated metabolic pathways were predicted by Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis. A Cytoscape network was constructed to explore the interrelationships of miRNAs, miRNA-target genes and target genes. A large number of miRNAs with diverse target genes will play important roles for further understanding some essential biological processes in E. denticulatum. The uncovered information can serve as an important reference for the protection and utilization of this unique red alga in the future.\n", "text": "Eucheuma denticulatum, an economically and industrially important red alga, is a valuable marine resource.
