MATERIALS AND METHODS: Parotid acinar cells were prepared from female NOD (NOD/ShiJcl) mice with or without diabetes, as well as from control (C57BL/6JJcl) mice. Total RNA and homogenate were prepared from the parotid acinar cells. Embryonic cDNA from a Mouse MTC (TM) Panel I kit was used. The expression of Bpifb1 was determined by cDNA microarray analysis, RT-PCR, real-time PCR, northern blotting and in situ hybridization. RESULTS: The expression of Bpifb1 mRNA was high in parotid acinar cells from diabetic and non-diabetic NOD mice at 5-50 weeks of age. Acinar cells in the C57BL/6 mice had a low expression of Bpifb1 mRNA at an age >8 weeks, but had a relatively high expression in the foetus and infantile stages. CONCLUSIONS: Bpifb1 mRNA is upregulated in parotid acinar cells in NOD mice, but its expression is not related to the onset of diabetes. These findings suggest that high expression levels of Bpifb1 might predict disease traits before the onset of autoimmunity.\n"}]}, "text": "OBJECTIVE: To define the increased mRNA expression of Bpifb1, a member of the bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein family, in parotid acinar cells from non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, an animal model for Sjogren's syndrome.
