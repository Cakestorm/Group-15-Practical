More than half of the families had a history of CPS involvement, a third received CPS services, and one-in-ten families had their child place in out of-home care following an investigation. After controlling for other types of maltreatment allegations and multiple covariates, families investigated for food neglect had a greater chance of being re-reported for a subsequent CPS investigations in a shorter length of time than families without an allegation of food neglect. While only a small percentage of families had a food neglect allegation, problems adequately feeding a child - whether due to severe poverty, inattentiveness, or abusive negligence - placed a family at a higher risk of a future CPS investigation.
