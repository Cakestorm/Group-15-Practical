{"title": "Article 2510", "body": {"ops": [{"insert": "Dysfibrinogenemia is characterized by blood coagulation dysfunction induced by an abnormal molecular structure of fibrinogen. Here, we describe a new case. A 32-year-old female was suspected of having dysfibrino-genemia during routine laboratory screening, based on her decreased functional fibrinogen level, normal fibrinogen antigen level, and prolonged thrombin time. We extracted DNA and performed polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing to identify genetic mutation. Fibrin polymerization, the kinetics of the fibrinopeptide release, scanning electron microscopy, mass spectrometric analysis, fibrin cross-linking, sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western blot were conducted. DNA sequencing identified a heterozygous point mutation, Gly13Arg in A alpha chain. Fibrin polymerization was markedly impaired (prolonged lag phase and decreased final turbidity). The rate and extent of fibrinopeptide A release from the patient were abnormal and reduced. The mass spectrometry analysis revealed the presence of mutant fibrinogen chains in the patient's circulation. Electron micro-graphs revealed abnormal fibrin clots. Fibrin cross-linking was normal. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western blot showed no difference. We report a new case with a mutation in the fibrinopeptide A region, A alpha Gly13Arg. These results indicated that the functional abnormalities were related to delayed and defective fibrinopeptide A cleavage and likely impaired thrombin binding.\n"}]}, "text": "Dysfibrinogenemia is characterized by blood coagulation dysfunction induced by an abnormal molecular structure of fibrinogen.
