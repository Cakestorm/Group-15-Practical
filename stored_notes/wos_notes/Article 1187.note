{"title": "Article 1187", "body": "Studies have demonstrated low expression of miR-145 associated with cell proliferation and migration in a wide variety of tumors. Here, we studied the expression of miR-145 in relation to the occurrence and development of breast cancer. Total RNA from breast cancer tissue and corresponding adjacent normal tissue was extracted and used to detect miR-145 expression by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). We also transfected breast cancer cells with hsa-miR-145 mimics, hsa-miR-145 inhibitor, mimics negative control (mimics NC) or inhibitor negative control (inhibitor NC). Cell proliferation was analyzed by colony formation assays and methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium assays. Cell proliferation in breast cancer cells was decreased after overexpression of miR-145 and increased following miR-145 suppression. Cell migration and invasion were assessed using Transwell and wound healing assays, respectively, and were also decreased after overexpression of miR-145 and increased after miR-145 suppression in breast cancer cells. Finally, western blot assays showed that over expression of miR-145 inhibited expression of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1). Collectively, these data suggest that miR-145 may inhibit TGF-beta 1 protein expression which may in turn contribute to tumor formation.\n", "text": "Studies have demonstrated low expression of miR-145 associated with cell proliferation and migration in a wide variety of tumors.
