{"title": "Article 1356", "body": "Leakage current reduction of the single-phase transformerless cascaded H-bridge PV inverter is investigated in this paper. The high-frequency common-mode loop model of a typical single-phase cascaded H-bridge PV system is established. Based on the model, the main factors that affect the leakage current are discussed. The reason why the typical single-phase cascaded H-bridge inverter fails to reduce the leakage current is explained. In order to solve the problem, a cascaded topology based on the H5 inverter is presented, along with a new modulation strategy, which can ensure that the stray capacitor voltage is free of high-frequency components. In this way, the leakage current can be effectively reduced. Finally, a prototype with TMS320F28335DSP+XC3S400FPGA digital control is built. The performance tests of cascaded H-bridge and the proposed topologies are carried out. The experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed solution.\n", "text": "Leakage current reduction of the single-phase transformerless cascaded H-bridge PV inverter is investigated in this paper.
