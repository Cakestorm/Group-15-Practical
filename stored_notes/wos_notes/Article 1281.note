{"body": "Background: Fatigue is highly prevalent after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT). It has been described as intense and may last for years following treatment. Objective: The aim of this study is to compare fatigue, physical activity, sleep, emotional distress, cognitive function, and biological measures in HCT survivors with persistent fatigue (n = 25) with age-and gender-matched healthy controls with occasional tiredness (n = 25). Methods: Data were collected using (a) objective, real-time assessments of physical activity and sleep over 7 days; (b) patient-reported fatigue assessments; (c) computerized objective testing of cognitive functioning; and (d) biological measures. Differences between groups were examined using multivariate analysis of variance. Results: Survivors of HCT reported increased physical (P <.001), mental (P <.001), and overall (P <.001) fatigue as well as increased anxiety (P <.05) and depression (P <.01) compared with healthy controls. Red blood cell (RBC) levels were significantly lower in HCT survivors (P <.001). Levels of RBC for both groups, however, were in the normal range. Tumor necrosis factor-! (P <.001) and interleukin-6 (P <.05) levels were significantly higher in HCT survivors. Conclusions: Persistent fatigue in HCT survivors compared with healthy controls with occasional tiredness is accompanied by increased anxiety and depression along with decreased RBC counts. Elevated tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 levels may be important biomarkers. Implications for Practice: This study provides preliminary support for the conceptualization of fatigue as existing on a continuum, with tiredness anchoring one end and exhaustion the other. Persistent fatigue experienced by HCT survivors is more severe than the occasional tiredness of everyday life.\n", "embeddings": ["0.018327622", "-0.9407521", "1.0908805", "0.2996117", "-0.8248838", "-0.6933335", "1.2266256", "2.304604", "-1.0079893", "-0.08463018", "-1.1876296", "-1.127728", "0.863261", "1.8008507", "-1.6029668", "0.7724391", "-0.33424756", "1.4708223", "1.0884056", "-2.7687461", "-1.0739226", "-0.37137425", "0.064735845", "-1.0942365", "-0.26369524", "0.11400675", "0.9517452", "-1.0785929", "-0.9581039", "-0.15050682", "0.2571381", "-0.80699307", "0.6254758", "-1.3570753", "-0.17903", "2.1134024", "-1.6622665", "-1.1076393", "0.24875171", "0.70297885", "-0.99208724", "-0.74078625", "-0.7891128", "-0.62594783", "-0.41457123", "0.38431633", "-0.054651152", "1.136927", "-0.20462327", "-0.049638268", "1.4903253", "-1.1904792", "0.3106663", "-1.1436849", "0.50485826", "-0.18943828", "-0.21717706", "-0.21312371", "0.866439", "0.40233165", "0.1926642", "-0.022309236", "-0.43418446", "0.29622182", "-1.0459263", "0.26171866", "0.34710303", "0.16825439", "0.24505028", "0.94352543", "-0.59989357", "-0.3665076", "-1.2757542", "-1.2494067", "0.3292397", "1.5424509", "0.9929885", "-0.71037185", "-2.1474216", "0.5676265", "-0.31043723", "-0.5190779", "0.5772841", "2.0708303", "-1.8698189", "-0.9683207", "-0.6451634", "-0.07032448", "-0.6959571", "-0.05772813", "0.65978366", "0.56751585", "0.079656206", "-0.21278521", "1.7975663", "0.12342266", "0.56574994", "0.021063514", "0.6444937", "0.19606343", "0.558361", "1.2333344", "0.8797381", "0.35716277", "-1.259445", "-2.1003406", "0.17751493", "1.5710832", "-1.2613003", "-1.9311655", "1.6844357", "-2.0449123", "-0.9719585", "-1.5098759", "-0.99060917", "-0.044971544", "0.9472708", "-1.5264902", "-0.7454182", "0.093285516", "-0.37031102", "-1.4120759", "0.91110015", "-0.35449252", "1.0672964", "-1.4534993", "0.7647191", "-0.110131785", "0.9089148", "-0.8705095", "1.3182074", "-0.56582093", "-0.5721331", "-0.95346093", "0.77011335", "0.80247736", "-0.99511683", "0.91169626", "0.009282315", "-0.18506795", "0.19048761", "0.109484285", "-0.20029315", "-0.31376338", "1.0250071", "-1.0693326", "-1.4871225", "0.15098763", "0.39538014", "0.062095452", "1.0359474", "0.5233068", "-1.7590864", "1.7042924", "-0.44606668", "0.28644228", "0.4286703", "0.8361628", "0.5897167", "0.79549444", "0.6740712", "0.99728006", "0.8799606", "0.1598459", "0.31078157", "-0.6371985", "-0.39040726", "-0.2818175", "-1.5990356", "0.12857537", "-0.3252723", "0.4615914", "0.88201296", "1.2802287", "0.8589447", "-1.2784956", "-1.0545682", "0.47548854", "-0.8223294", "-0.17151962", "0.07383477", "1.1799623", "-1.9223394", "-0.08303794", "1.1055118", "0.66313785", "0.15468402", "1.7159443", "-0.39504147", "0.0007287806", "0.17721441", "-0.35096863", "-1.0073495", "0.66517794", "-0.37420458", "-0.26655966", "-1.627876", "0.6817036", "-1.0576326", "-0.40018138"]}
