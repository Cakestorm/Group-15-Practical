The frequency of eosinophilia-associated coronary artery vasospasm in patients with AERD, a disease characterized by blood and respiratory tissue eosinophilia, however, is unknown. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to understand the cause of the chest pain described above and determine the most appropriate treatment for it. METHODS: A chart review of 153 patients with AERD who are followed at Brigham and Women's Hospital was performed. Patients who reported any type of chest pain were assessed for the presence of cardiac risk factors, eosinophilia, and response of chest pain to a variety of treatments. Two patients with AERD and eosinophilia who had recurrent chest pain due to suspected vasospasm are described in detail, and 8 other cases are also summarized. RESULTS: Of the 153 patients reviewed, 10 had a history of chest pain concerning for ischemia. Of the 10 patients with chest pain, 8 had undergone aspirin desensitization and initiated high-dose aspirin therapy; of these, 6 reported an increase in the frequency or severity of chest pain while on high-dose aspirin with improvement after aspirin discontinuation or dose reduction. Many patients had traditional cardiac risk factors, but none had any evidence of coronary atherosclerosis; almost all had significant eosinophilia. Their chest pain did not improve with typical antianginal treatments but did respond to corticosteroid therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Although uncommon, patients with AERD can develop eosinophilia-associated coronary artery vasospasm, which is occasionally worsened by high-dose aspirin. Patients with AERD who present with symptoms of ischemic chest pain should be screened for eosinophilia, as early treatment with corticosteroids can be life-saving.
