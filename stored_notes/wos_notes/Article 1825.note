{"body": "Objective: Cognitive remediation programs often have larger effects on cognition compared with everyday outcomes. We compared changes across cognitive, functional competence, and vocational domains in 2 cognitive remediation programs. Method: A sequential enrollment, nonrandom design with 50 individuals with serious mental illnesses (psychotic and mood disorders) from a community vocational rehabilitation program. Action-Based Cognitive Remediation (ABCR), a new program that combines traditional cognitive training techniques with simulated workplace situations and goal setting for engaging with cognitively demanding activities (N = 24; 19 completers) was compared with traditional cognitive remediation (tCR; N = 26; 15 completers). Both groups met twice-weekly for 2-hr sessions over 10 weeks. Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to examine effects pre-and posttreatment and 10 weeks after treatment. Univariate analysis of variance and chi-square tests were used to compare work outcomes 6 months after intervention. Results: Significantly more ABCR participants (83%) were retained in the intervention compared with tCR (57%) and reported greater increases in perceived competence with cognitively challenging tasks (eta(2) =.23). ABCR effects were significantly larger than tCR on functional competence (eta(2) =.53), with smaller, nonsignificant differences in social cognition (eta(2) =.14) and neurocognition (eta(2) =.16). ABCR participants were marginally more likely to be competitively employed (68.4% vs. 40%) and, among those employed, ABCR participants experienced less job-related stress (eta(2) =.37). Conclusions and Implications for Practice: Cognitive rehabilitative programs for serious mental illness that rely on computer -based training for neuroplasticity should ensure opportunities for active skill development and therapist supported techniques to overcome challenges with generalizing cognitive effects to everyday outcomes.\n", "embeddings": ["1.1743282", "-0.6945765", "0.4161184", "1.16365", "-1.6756064", "-0.4735658", "1.2184674", "1.7273157", "-1.571078", "0.6873085", "-1.2991178", "-1.9719025", "-1.0438335", "1.1040381", "-1.7114451", "-0.04232297", "0.5355436", "0.5892811", "-0.0911585", "-1.7635671", "0.66906697", "-0.58759415", "-0.3251264", "-0.21666339", "1.388349", "1.0337827", "1.7658415", "-1.438025", "0.010667232", "1.8039123", "0.8181151", "-0.69401824", "-0.19584739", "-1.2913383", "0.40503764", "2.988105", "-1.4897774", "0.35623625", "-0.22900352", "-0.3771448", "-1.9033439", "-1.173186", "0.9830018", "0.11865108", "-0.010008658", "-1.8339375", "-0.99320793", "0.7718333", "0.3394022", "-0.9683", "-0.253896", "-0.27566838", "0.33385432", "-1.398792", "0.63403463", "1.5911986", "0.87995976", "0.8008548", "0.916758", "-0.59847087", "0.5687711", "1.3330433", "0.082991146", "1.5677062", "0.4759654", "0.33959886", "0.22532415", "-0.4963526", "-0.59911287", "0.06551415", "0.11733894", "-1.2545873", "0.09154503", "0.8835595", "0.49420384", "0.5936861", "0.3126256", "-1.2460202", "0.62140447", "-0.4223977", "-0.8176731", "-0.61270255", "0.5617474", "1.9254986", "-3.1994696", "0.5615322", "0.118324704", "0.25245062", "0.54938495", "-0.1272349", "2.3220527", "0.62229407", "-0.17940955", "-0.92135847", "0.59206426", "-0.09188929", "0.71365535", "-0.9355497", "0.05395178", "0.015903436", "0.73366976", "-0.2430947", "0.65863967", "0.7615402", "-0.589863", "-2.4094822", "0.5174129", "1.4597878", "-0.089293376", "-0.9146427", "-0.4033316", "-1.9681709", "-0.654115", "1.0805753", "1.4637542", "-0.8455381", "2.834223", "-2.1347303", "0.31603876", "-1.407515", "-1.1443882", "-1.0466298", "0.65816283", "-0.058189675", "-0.7203033", "2.1326392", "-2.500094", "0.47447202", "0.725111", "-1.0828897", "0.26819304", "1.7764913", "-0.2445886", "-0.03618762", "0.06092129", "1.1907926", "-0.53941655", "0.07608059", "0.43430147", "0.42395094", "-0.35176", "-0.19426598", "-0.08496599", "-0.042389464", "-0.43195906", "-0.5253721", "-1.9640502", "0.33450773", "0.5715193", "0.9232051", "0.28944737", "-0.26372746", "1.2971671", "-0.36172062", "-1.9713488", "-1.2110627", "-0.56264347", "0.22932531", "0.8720704", "0.048397377", "0.18992957", "0.7336946", "0.57794356", "0.28210676", "0.6612525", "0.6870862", "0.06280315", "1.6140441", "-0.21997015", "1.2905767", "0.5016008", "0.29906595", "1.5399325", "-0.010015877", "-0.3700532", "0.7839692", "-1.0947086", "1.3901397", "-1.3538797", "-0.513747", "0.45964926", "0.68555397", "1.1286544", "1.1664015", "-1.0329792", "0.6090572", "-1.3153633", "0.1990066", "1.1819792", "1.5592737", "0.62986183", "1.5440302", "0.48265097", "-0.96563125", "-2.2303042", "0.40273145", "0.9543276", "2.2084212", "0.5037361", "-0.14680211"]}
