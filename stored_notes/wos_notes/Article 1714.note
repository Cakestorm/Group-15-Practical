{"body": "Patients with decompensated cirrhosis have high morbidity and are commonly hospitalized with acute kidney injury. We examined serum levels of Siglec-7, a transmembrane receptor that regulates immune activity, as a biomarker for mortality in patients with cirrhosis and acute kidney injury. Serum Siglec-7 was measured in hospitalized patients with cirrhosis and acute kidney injury, as well as in reference groups with acute liver injury/acute kidney injury, cirrhosis without acute kidney injury, and sepsis without liver disease. Clinical characteristics and subsequent outcomes were examined using univariate and multivariable analyses according to initial Siglec-7 levels. Primary outcome was death by 90 days. One hundred twenty-eight subjects were included, 92 of which had cirrhosis and acute kidney injury and were used in the primary analysis. Average Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score was 24 [95 % CI 23, 26], and serum creatinine was 2.5 [2.2, 2.8] mg/dL at the time Siglec-7 was measured. After adjusting for age and MELD score, high serum Siglec-7 level predicted mortality with a hazard ratio of 1.96 [1.04, 3.69; p = 0.04]. There was no difference in Siglec-7 levels by etiology of AKI (p = 0.24). Addition of serum Siglec-7 to MELD score improved discrimination for 90-day mortality [category-free net reclassification index = 0.38 (p = 0.04); integrated discrimination increment = 0.043 (p = 0.04)]. Serum Siglec-7 was associated with increased mortality among hospitalized patients with cirrhosis and acute kidney injury. Addition of Siglec-7 to MELD score may increase discrimination to predict 90-day mortality.\n", "embeddings": ["0.5962413", "-2.4937577", "-1.4209352", "-0.22877261", "0.2218824", "-0.022458926", "-0.058757156", "1.9031142", "-1.8919055", "0.30159658", "-0.8255744", "0.7610043", "0.22129199", "1.3105221", "0.48177275", "1.3549504", "-0.012882006", "-0.05882955", "0.2362268", "-2.0330145", "-0.808397", "-0.33226258", "1.3735521", "0.15846181", "0.5240671", "-0.6452467", "1.4405552", "-0.2691551", "-0.19995838", "-0.052646432", "-0.63007903", "-0.82745945", "1.1100253", "-0.8773874", "-0.5831792", "0.06302884", "0.9225447", "-0.073086485", "0.25498015", "-0.63206536", "-0.8507537", "-0.40879148", "-0.23100616", "0.064965375", "0.7656516", "-0.13299473", "1.730766", "0.44625202", "0.66522324", "-1.3990391", "0.5117754", "-0.35154969", "0.18224624", "0.1662087", "-0.18932891", "-0.15342754", "0.018049674", "-0.26068237", "0.056685936", "-0.62159455", "-0.13614942", "-0.7057739", "-0.84904104", "-0.035651375", "-0.35040793", "-1.9436147", "-0.0023873998", "1.3320402", "-1.3784693", "1.6110691", "0.007299988", "-0.18894112", "1.2367611", "-0.63445276", "-0.296207", "1.6518756", "-1.5352226", "-1.1951717", "-0.4826992", "1.3387566", "-2.2397768", "-2.2004576", "0.40152663", "1.7476324", "-0.3513206", "1.9189537", "-0.52325624", "0.9234097", "-0.7699123", "-0.13271962", "2.2481477", "1.365671", "0.6335775", "-0.4610581", "0.7165443", "-0.2798256", "0.40777773", "-0.17391238", "-0.0118007865", "-0.3920214", "0.7638689", "0.08142215", "0.6791014", "-0.29464695", "-0.097832166", "-0.5813381", "0.7258494", "1.0539132", "-0.03196377", "-1.0233413", "0.093532495", "-0.7753653", "0.5315685", "-1.6846061", "-1.1018285", "-2.0396547", "0.2456687", "-0.7337915", "-2.0884748", "-1.0248495", "-0.83702856", "0.3726565", "1.004177", "-0.8674258", "0.91233635", "0.22400486", "-0.057891134", "-2.2188013", "-0.5805647", "0.1690362", "0.52481616", "0.4290453", "-1.2041396", "-1.0438032", "0.37782356", "0.46000215", "-0.81677926", "0.025412396", "-0.8426341", "-0.5910345", "-0.49529412", "0.32903233", "-0.06027412", "-0.995294", "0.1742477", "0.4029904", "0.50375056", "-0.91273725", "0.09044192", "1.290444", "0.2731399", "0.1296639", "-1.2420055", "-0.23626044", "-1.8878716", "1.3677888", "0.5075855", "1.6545115", "1.3197746", "-1.379595", "0.6772789", "0.3465932", "0.2297345", "0.7435002", "-0.8872677", "0.40851533", "-0.93577886", "-1.4683563", "-1.8260915", "-1.4114814", "1.7236135", "0.2851575", "0.75753605", "-1.0348207", "-0.5071098", "-0.29632464", "-0.7275098", "-0.56636834", "2.0178916", "-0.6458151", "0.09880126", "0.7812648", "0.5531152", "-0.091883086", "0.5586178", "0.6374413", "0.15159708", "2.937444", "-0.42164543", "0.14794229", "1.8584676", "-1.6940726", "-0.10825424", "-1.2390178", "0.5880665", "-0.20432682", "1.605625", "-0.6246062", "-0.22753291", "-0.43560553"]}
