We examined serum levels of Siglec-7, a transmembrane receptor that regulates immune activity, as a biomarker for mortality in patients with cirrhosis and acute kidney injury. Serum Siglec-7 was measured in hospitalized patients with cirrhosis and acute kidney injury, as well as in reference groups with acute liver injury/acute kidney injury, cirrhosis without acute kidney injury, and sepsis without liver disease. Clinical characteristics and subsequent outcomes were examined using univariate and multivariable analyses according to initial Siglec-7 levels. Primary outcome was death by 90 days. One hundred twenty-eight subjects were included, 92 of which had cirrhosis and acute kidney injury and were used in the primary analysis. Average Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score was 24 [95 % CI 23, 26], and serum creatinine was 2.5 [2.2, 2.8] mg/dL at the time Siglec-7 was measured. After adjusting for age and MELD score, high serum Siglec-7 level predicted mortality with a hazard ratio of 1.96 [1.04, 3.69; p = 0.04]. There was no difference in Siglec-7 levels by etiology of AKI (p = 0.24). Addition of serum Siglec-7 to MELD score improved discrimination for 90-day mortality [category-free net reclassification index = 0.38 (p = 0.04); integrated discrimination increment = 0.043 (p = 0.04)]. Serum Siglec-7 was associated with increased mortality among hospitalized patients with cirrhosis and acute kidney injury. Addition of Siglec-7 to MELD score may increase discrimination to predict 90-day mortality.\n"}]}, "text": "Patients with decompensated cirrhosis have high morbidity and are commonly hospitalized with acute kidney injury.
