{"title": "Article 1890", "body": "Composite lymphomas (CLs) are defined as two unrelated lymphomas occurring at the same time within the same tissue. The incidence of these tumors is low. Of all possible combinations between lymphomas, the least frequent are the ones combining peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). We recently identified five cases of CL composed of PTCL and classical HL, mixed cellularity type. We investigated histological and clinical features of these cases. Immunostaining was performed on paraffin sections. PTCL cells were positive for CD8 and TIA-1 in four of the five cases. Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells were positive for CD30 and weakly positive for PAX5 in all cases, positive for CD15 in three of five cases, positive for CD20 in one of five cases, and negative for EBER. Monoclonal rearrangement of the T-cell receptor (TCR) and immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) genes was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using whole paraffin sections. We concluded more precisely the monoclonality of the IGH rearrangement of HRS cells based on single-cell PCR for IGH and DNA sequencing analysis after laser microdissection of single cells in one case. HL can occur in CD8-positive and TIA-1-positive PTCL. Clinicians should recognize the possibility of these CL.\n", "text": "Composite lymphomas (CLs) are defined as two unrelated lymphomas occurring at the same time within the same tissue.
