{"body": "Objective This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of the Functional Independence Measure to assess preoperative frailty for elderly patients undergoing surgical aortic valve replacement. Methods Eighty-five patients >65 years who survived elective isolated aortic valve replacement from January 2008 to October 2015 were included. The mean age at the operation was 78 +/- 6 years old (n = 28 males, n = 57 females). The patients were divided into two groups according to their status at discharge: impossible to discharge home or hospitalization for >30 days (compromised group, n = 8), or unaffected (unaffected group, n = 77). Preoperative frailty was evaluated with the Functional Independence Measure, which comprises 18 items divided into six domains: self-care, sphincter control, mobility, locomotion, communication, and social cognition. Results The preoperative total Functional Independence Measure score was significantly lower in the compromised group (79 +/- 32) than in the unaffected group (120 +/- 9, p < 0.01). The preoperative motor Functional Independence Measure score was significantly lower in the compromised group (45 +/- 24) than in the unaffected group (85 +/- 9, p = < 0.01). The duration of postoperative intubation, intensive care unit stay, and postoperative hospitalization were significantly longer in the compromised group than in the unaffected group (48 +/- 67 vs 16 +/- 12 h, p < 0.01; 6.7 +/- 5.3 vs 3.4 +/- 2.0 days, p < 0.01; 34 +/- 27 vs 23 +/- 11 days, p = 0.02, respectively). Conclusions The preoperative Functional Independence Measure is effective for assessing preoperative frailty in elderly patients undergoing aortic valve replacement in terms of predicting operative morbidity.\n", "embeddings": ["-0.14109431", "-2.1077917", "0.9321997", "0.78032124", "1.032151", "-0.46590468", "-0.07526571", "1.7764257", "-0.6532733", "0.30165014", "-0.7267507", "0.010748161", "-0.39553288", "-0.20823315", "0.102613345", "-0.99781406", "-0.8212911", "-0.06417723", "0.2753162", "-2.6587715", "-0.69942236", "-0.63755125", "-0.44662142", "-0.0706189", "0.7484659", "0.5643744", "0.4566857", "-0.44761926", "-0.8920427", "0.01404819", "-0.07576063", "-0.03069763", "1.055712", "-0.6155408", "-1.1818061", "-0.60367906", "-0.39949682", "-0.85114044", "-0.008071974", "0.381696", "0.008124836", "-0.6735226", "0.55056775", "0.30422795", "0.6635154", "-0.54934114", "-0.18865772", "1.6039444", "-1.4134942", "-0.16337405", "0.8079935", "-0.8405201", "0.26317674", "-0.8833261", "-0.6034097", "0.71029586", "1.0261956", "2.05655", "-0.32908076", "0.32904428", "-0.07040342", "0.79579514", "0.11932165", "0.4089101", "-0.11355148", "0.74660754", "-0.59048766", "0.28112662", "-0.3198217", "1.5355102", "0.27078095", "1.428825", "0.6506905", "0.4943799", "0.82104987", "1.5559126", "0.09127185", "-0.08676966", "-1.3005131", "-1.4135622", "0.18163258", "-1.3989016", "0.029548181", "2.3667023", "-1.6503012", "-1.876257", "0.5737048", "-0.2006333", "-0.7248121", "-0.886171", "1.6535434", "-0.30402386", "0.004573924", "0.15537803", "2.1896036", "1.3044946", "-0.07538513", "0.27013153", "-1.4062699", "1.0118853", "0.7068832", "-0.05652692", "-0.094647214", "-0.59894556", "-1.5242751", "-2.5202756", "1.31816", "0.17442216", "-0.5314864", "-1.1126834", "-1.244048", "-0.76747465", "0.442681", "0.23714828", "0.1923845", "-1.5656387", "1.7153254", "-0.37294623", "-1.102874", "-0.5431405", "0.2288235", "0.17523398", "2.4539728", "0.70838237", "-0.5673495", "0.6796519", "-0.14806846", "-0.3182398", "0.4711472", "0.4461366", "0.93908846", "-0.4876393", "-0.5742811", "-0.50455093", "1.0195427", "1.6812406", "0.29717377", "0.50559336", "0.15642893", "-0.17899597", "0.49665886", "0.7635671", "0.056292146", "-0.039042823", "-0.43134874", "-1.5650675", "0.73100555", "0.89801854", "0.89463425", "0.5187235", "0.5109002", "-1.5780118", "-0.5370628", "-0.5374987", "0.16603957", "0.1577434", "-1.003385", "0.41550654", "-1.4207892", "-0.20549178", "0.65513027", "1.1019733", "1.3193791", "0.4481997", "0.6357873", "-0.31926137", "-0.00090585777", "-0.7311696", "-1.4918408", "-0.025822714", "-0.76706237", "-0.3320513", "-0.107045524", "-0.743125", "0.2008132", "0.8935821", "-1.0912287", "0.468752", "-0.31656447", "-0.177185", "-0.5265575", "0.003807059", "-0.49588984", "-1.3031373", "0.47971663", "-1.6484386", "-0.7182241", "0.46539718", "1.2318935", "0.94930756", "0.7693346", "-0.18011503", "-0.80407256", "-0.84459865", "-0.5659183", "-0.5237041", "1.0838692", "0.5503345", "0.05068478", "0.18074656"]}
