{"title": "Article 1625", "body": "This study explored the influences on living arrangements of orphans and vulnerable children (OVC) housed at a community-based home in Johannesburg, South Africa. A total of 50 OVC (males = 36%, females = 64%; age range 11 to 18 years) completed an open-ended questionnaire, while some of them also participated in individual interviews and focus group discussions on how they became residents of the community-based home. The data were thematically analysed. Findings suggest their choice to live in a community-based care setting to have been influenced by homelessness with accompanying poverty, health issues, experiences of child abuse and neglect, discrimination, and domestic violence. School psychologists working with OVC from community-based homes should consider pathways by which the children could be provided with needed support for resilient health and wellness.\n", "text": "This study explored the influences on living arrangements of orphans and vulnerable children (OVC) housed at a community-based home in Johannesburg, South Africa.
