Dogs randomly received a soluble TNF inhibitor (etanercept, 0.5 mg/kg intravenously) or saline before occlusion. Collateral blood flow and risk region size (RISK) were measured with radioactive microspheres, infarct size (INF) was measured by triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining, inflammation was measured by tissue mycloperoxidase (MPO) activity, intercellular adhesion molecular-1 (ICAM-1) messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) was measured by Northern blotting, and ICAM-1 protein expression was measured by Western blotting. NF kappa B activation was measured in nuclear extracts by electrophoretlic mobility shift assays. INF/RISK was significantly smaller in the etanercept group than in the saline control group after adjusting for collateral flow (P < 0.009 by analysis of covariance, mean reduction in INF/RISK = 40%, 0.32 +/- 0.09 versus 0.53 +/- 0.09). MPO activity, ICAM-1 mRNA and protein expression, and NF kappa B binding activity were all significantly reduced in the etanercept group.
