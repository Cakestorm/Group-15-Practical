{"title": "Article 1353", "body": "Phase noise correction is crucial to exploit full advantage of orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) in modern high-data-rate communications. OFDM channel estimation with simultaneous phase noise compensation has therefore drawn much attention and stimulated continuing efforts. Existing methods, however, either have not taken into account the fundamental properties of phase noise or are only able to provide estimates of limited applicability owing to considerable computational complexity. In this paper, we have reformulated the joint phase noise and channel estimation problem in the time domain as opposed to existing frequency-domain approaches, which enables us to develop much more efficient algorithms using the majorization-minimization technique. In addition, we propose two methods based on dimensionality reduction and regularization, respectively, that can adapt to various phase noise levels and signal-to-noise ratio and achieve much lower estimation errors than the benchmarks without incurring much additional computational cost. Several numerical examples with phase noise generated by free-running oscillators or phase-locked loops demonstrate that our proposed algorithms outperform existing methods with respect to both computational efficiency and mean squared error within a large range of SNRs.\n", "text": "Phase noise correction is crucial to exploit full advantage of orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) in modern high-data-rate communications.
