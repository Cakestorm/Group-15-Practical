{"title": "Article 406", "body": {"ops": [{"insert": "Background: The aim of this study was to investigate the application of mucous membrane keratinocyte cultures on amniotic membrane and on poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) Purasorb PL38 to cover tissue loss in the oral cavity. Developments in molecular biology techniques and tissue engineering allow the culturing and identification of cells that can be anchored in the wound to achieve integrity of the tissue. Transplantation of tissues obtained from the patient's own cells is superior to allogenous transplantation where there is a possibility of transfection, rejection and the need for long-term immunosuppression. Methods: In 9 patients (15 procedures) keratinocytes cultured on amniotic membrane and PLLA were transplanted to cover antro-oral fistulas and bone loss after osteoradionecrosis. Results: In all 6 patients with outlasting antro-oral fistulas, the defects were healed. In 3 patients with 5 cases of tissue loss after osteoradionecrosis, we obtained healing of the wound in only 1 case. Histological examination of the cultures indicated that cultured cells formed well-differentiated layers, very similar to the keratinocytes of mucous membranes, although those seeded on amniotic membrane formed a single layer of cells, while those seeded on the PLLA scaffold were arranged on 2 or more layers: these differences were shown to be statistically significant with a morphometric analysis. Conclusions: Autologous transplants of epithelium cultured on amniotic membrane and PLLA constitute a new and effective way of covering nonhealing tissue loss in the oral cavity in chosen cases, using modern methods of tissue engineering.\n"}]}, "text": "Background: The aim of this study was to investigate the application of mucous membrane keratinocyte cultures on amniotic membrane and on poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) Purasorb PL38 to cover tissue loss in the oral cavity.
