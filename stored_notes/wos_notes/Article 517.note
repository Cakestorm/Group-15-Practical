A coordinated remodeling of N- and O-glycosylation, and an increase in the presentation of the endogenous lectin galectin-1 sensing these changes on the surface of p16INK4a-expressing pancreatic carcinoma cells (Capan-1), lead to potent pro-anoikis signals. We show that the p16INK4a-dependent impact on growth-regulatory lectins is not limited to galectin-1, but also concerns galectin-3.

Nuclear run-off and northern blotting experiments revealed an effect of the presence of p16INK4a on steady-state levels of galectin-3-specific mRNA that differed from decreasing the transcriptional rate.
