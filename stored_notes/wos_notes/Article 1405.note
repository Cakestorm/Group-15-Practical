{"body": "Background and Objectives: Early growth response-1 is a nuclear transcription factor implicated in regulating cell proliferation. Fibroblast growth factor-1 is the prototypic fibroblast growth factor involved in the proliferation and differentiation of various cell types. Expression of early growth response-1 induced by fibroblast growth factor-1 thus may be very important for cell growth, during both development and wound healing in oral tissue. However, little is known about the expression and kinetics of early growth response-1 in fibroblast growth factor-1-stimulated oral cells. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of fibroblast growth factor-1 on the expression of early growth response-1 in human periodontal ligament cells. Material and Methods: Periodontal ligament cells were cultured in medium containing 1, 10 or 100 ng/mL of fibroblast growth factor-1 for 45 min or with 10 ng/mL of fibroblast growth factor-1 for 15, 30, 45, 60 or 120 min. The proliferation of periodontal ligament cells was evaluated by measuring 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation. The expression of early growth response-1 mRNA and protein, and the localization of early growth response-1 protein, were examined by western blotting, northern blotting and immunocytostaining. Results: 5-Bromo-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation correlated directly with increases in fibroblast growth factor-1 concentration, and 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation peaked 45 min after starting treatment. Early growth response-1 protein was expressed in response to a concentration of fibroblast growth factor-1 as low as 1 ng. Peak expression of early growth response-1 mRNA was observed at 15 min and that of early growth response-1 protein at 60 min. The 140-kDa early growth response-1 protein was not detected in the nuclear fraction, and the peak expression of the 80-kDa early growth response-1 protein occurred at 60 min. Early growth response-1 localized in or around the nucleus at 30 min. Conclusion: These results show that a concentration of fibroblast growth factor-1 as low as 1 ng induces the expression of early growth response-1 protein, and that the 80-kDa early growth response-1 protein functions in the nucleus of periodontal ligament cells treated with fibroblast growth factor-1.\n", "embeddings": ["-1.2404181", "0.7010956", "1.6761615", "-2.0464487", "1.2912308", "-1.5299966", "1.1872648", "1.2887095", "-2.267189", "1.2635068", "-0.13037199", "0.7483644", "0.28426307", "0.8662278", "-0.48399144", "-1.8576114", "-0.7740283", "0.15780106", "-0.99790525", "-1.7530273", "0.58897024", "0.5049395", "0.42266724", "-0.98309976", "0.77124256", "0.14051117", "0.18215351", "0.59995586", "-0.35515743", "-0.6235084", "1.169729", "0.14808288", "-0.5787249", "0.07481262", "0.07723282", "-0.04546361", "-0.502267", "-0.9230686", "0.9002206", "0.062605835", "1.869424", "-0.1955019", "-0.47249708", "-2.045051", "1.7163198", "-0.4230279", "0.2546725", "1.2815967", "-0.28969425", "0.3499502", "2.1250594", "-0.3174286", "0.85562015", "-0.43080932", "-0.3289975", "0.4583037", "-0.34217533", "-1.17297", "-0.22322522", "0.457978", "-0.7147939", "-0.28473774", "-0.5803438", "0.26961762", "-0.41770294", "0.9160134", "1.7555835", "-0.09221853", "-0.91223115", "1.5122811", "-0.9001109", "-0.5124157", "-0.14682737", "-0.6063743", "-0.6636122", "1.6991438", "0.21417783", "-2.2166574", "-0.57614285", "-0.710157", "0.6384598", "-1.4013138", "-0.63672286", "1.339119", "-0.25457582", "-1.6099305", "0.32975855", "0.31278324", "-0.96602535", "-0.2356706", "0.76337147", "0.8314034", "-0.83784777", "-0.050298326", "1.7698737", "1.3397887", "-1.3502811", "0.6978474", "-0.94221675", "0.67061067", "0.17189805", "1.7070165", "-0.27163655", "0.29661083", "-1.1968488", "0.2570968", "0.8973466", "2.2430418", "-0.25734928", "-1.3783413", "-2.1101465", "-1.92697", "1.2654791", "1.2809939", "-0.67829204", "-1.0257126", "1.202835", "-1.2364013", "-2.4214857", "-0.28806877", "-0.7637788", "1.6629162", "2.1638417", "-1.1274076", "0.7964635", "0.4767876", "-0.13502744", "-0.9845305", "-0.7326039", "0.04212959", "1.5780967", "0.059096348", "0.4297625", "-0.00848247", "1.5685205", "0.33516744", "0.07350933", "-0.67115337", "-1.308819", "1.4436922", "-0.662808", "-0.3837878", "0.018974", "-0.7833987", "1.2290176", "0.9766329", "-0.54047185", "0.5856461", "-0.5938916", "1.3354541", "0.46825877", "-1.3157952", "-1.89645", "0.059942987", "0.25756434", "1.7243955", "1.1664621", "-0.0959077", "-0.49641705", "1.1015376", "0.24759266", "1.5387201", "2.0055997", "-0.87631077", "1.1386307", "1.7863383", "0.26253808", "-0.6543605", "-0.038136102", "-0.50912225", "0.4290379", "-0.9734958", "0.7744144", "-0.35932285", "1.7857479", "0.2669744", "0.041385487", "-1.0907153", "0.66865796", "-0.035906486", "-0.48755428", "-1.0694684", "0.57216305", "0.1311003", "-0.019128546", "-0.23342802", "-0.8880614", "1.1939961", "1.3818742", "-0.5444964", "0.9150687", "0.014611205", "0.71136415", "0.5834233", "0.101324245", "0.34546933", "0.6346995", "-0.34191892", "1.020266", "-0.1854455"]}
