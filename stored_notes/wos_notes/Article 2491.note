{"title": "Article 2491", "body": "The division-summation (D-Sigma) current control and one-cycle voltage regulation (OCVR) of a 5-kW surface-mounted permanent-magnet synchronous generator (SPMSG) drive is developed. With the advancement of motor manufacturing, motor design, digital control units and power electronics converters, the permanent-magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) is broadly applied to electric vehicles, hybrid electric vehicles, flywheel energy storage system and wind power generators. Satisfactory current control scheme of a PMSG is significant to achieve desired generating performance. The D-Sigma current control is proposed and derived from the conventional space-vector modulation and two-phase modulation. A simplification of the complex self-and mutual inductances in a PMSG is demonstrated. The proposed current control can achieve the current waveform tracking through the simplification of winding inductances without parameter designing procedure of the feedback controller. The computation time of the microcontroller is reduced via the proposed current control scheme. The processing times of the conventional control and the D-Sigma control are compared. Moreover, the dc-link voltage can be well regulated by the proposed OCVR. This method can reduce the complexity of the voltage controller design. The merits of these two methods are easy to implement and the parameter designing procedure of the feedback controller is unnecessary. In addition, the system stability and the parameter sensitivity are analyzed and evaluated. Some measured waveforms verify the current tracking, torque ripple, dynamic performance and voltage regulation of the SPMSG drive. The reduction of the switching losses is verified by the calculation results.\n", "text": "The division-summation (D-Sigma) current control and one-cycle voltage regulation (OCVR) of a 5-kW surface-mounted permanent-magnet synchronous generator (SPMSG) drive is developed.
