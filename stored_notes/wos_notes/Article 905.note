{"title": "Article 905", "body": "Introduction: Depressive symptoms are common in patients assessed by neuropsychologists, and these symptoms can have an effect on cognitive functioning. Discrepancies between patient- and informant-reported depressive symptoms have been found in some diagnostic groups, raising concerns as to the value of assessing depressive symptoms via self-report alone. This study aimed to examine the relationship between these discrepancies and cognitive functioning in a heterogeneous outpatient neuropsychological sample. Method: Sixty-two patients with a variety of diagnoses (e.g., stroke, mild cognitive impairment) completed a measure of depressive symptoms and a battery of neuropsychological tests. Informants also rated the patients' depressive symptoms and completed a measure of the patients' functional abilities. Results: Patient and informant reports of depressive symptoms were moderately correlated; larger differences between patient- and informant-reported symptoms were associated with poorer verbal learning and memory and greater functional impairments. Conclusions: The moderate level of agreement found for depressive symptoms is consistent with past studies using specific neuropsychological patient groups and other studies in both clinical and non-clinical populations. These results highlight the utility of collecting informant reports of depressive symptoms in neuropsychological evaluations.\n", "text": "Introduction: Depressive symptoms are common in patients assessed by neuropsychologists, and these symptoms can have an effect on cognitive functioning.
