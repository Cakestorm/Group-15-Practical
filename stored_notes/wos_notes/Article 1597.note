{"title": "Article 1597", "body": "This paper addresses child abuse and the Social Services protection and builds upon a study of verdicts concerning 2 Care of Young Persons Act (CYPA). The aim was to explore the extent of, and what characterised, the violence the children were being subjected to. A central finding was that of all the applications of 2 CYPA during one year concerning 196 children, 13-18 years, 70% concerned children reported as subjected to violence. The violence was in most cases described as severe and systematically exerted over many years with intimidating tactics of power and control. More girls than boys were in question for care because of violence. Girls were also to a greater extent reported as having been subjected to sexual abuse or coercive control of their sexuality in relation to standards regarding honour and virginity. In an international perspective the findings can be said to confirm the need to analyse such factors as gender, power and control when research and interventions concerns children abused by their parents. In a Swedish context the findings can be said to suggest that the 2 CYPA is a crucial intervention to protect children from violence.\n", "text": "This paper addresses child abuse and the Social Services protection and builds upon a study of verdicts concerning 2 Care of Young Persons Act (CYPA).
