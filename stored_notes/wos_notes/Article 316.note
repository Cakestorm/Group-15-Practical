{"body": "Aldosterone has been shown to stimulate renal TGF-beta(1) expression. However, the mechanisms for aldosterone-induced TGF-beta(1) expression have not been clearly determined in mesangial cells. We examined the role of extracellular-signal regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and activator protein-1 (AP-1) in the aldosterone-induced TGF-beta(1) expression in rat mesangial cells. TGF-beta(1) protein in the conditioned medium released from rat mesangial cells was measured by sandwich ELISA, TGF-beta(1) mRNA expression was analyzed by Northern blotting, AP-1 DNA binding activity was measured by EMSA and the ERK1/2, JNK activity was analyzed by western blotting. Aldosterone significantly stimulated TGF-beta(1) protein production and TGF-beta(1) mRNA expression in mesangial cells in a dose-dependent manner. Aldosterone significantly increased AP-1 DNA binding activity in mesangial cells. Pre-treatment of cells with AP-1 inhibitor, curcumin, blocked aldosterone-induced AP-1 DNA binding activity as well as aldosterone-induced TGF-beta(1) production. Aldosterone increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and JNK in mesangial cells. Pre-treatment of cells with ERK1/2 inhibitor, PD98059, or JNK inhibitor, SP600125 significantly inhibited aldosterone-induced ERK1/2 and JNK activity and subsequently TGF-beta(1) production, respectively. We conclude that aldosterone-induced TGF-beta(1) expression in mesangial cells is regulated by the ERK1/2, JNK and AP-1 intracellular signaling pathways.\n", "embeddings": ["-0.32005107", "0.71174145", "-0.080235876", "-0.8807886", "0.26938364", "-0.98047465", "-0.11210929", "1.2721491", "-1.6868305", "0.21916585", "-0.20515089", "-0.087177254", "-1.1118227", "0.77127033", "-0.90889144", "0.38020968", "0.79145014", "-0.03371678", "-0.066390105", "-1.0135232", "0.46605876", "-2.1245146", "-0.8540676", "-0.5965296", "-0.3141982", "-0.09801628", "-0.228818", "1.557285", "-0.84908", "-0.7198022", "0.53888386", "0.60267824", "0.090312645", "-0.97177595", "0.61234736", "0.10608713", "1.5541602", "-1.0151975", "0.2514345", "0.9371689", "0.124545", "-1.1279322", "-0.23481153", "-1.8270264", "0.0916045", "-1.2131299", "-0.4135616", "0.5816252", "0.2136945", "-0.18407935", "-0.49098638", "0.4388282", "0.7111045", "-0.48636314", "0.19267836", "-0.2626475", "-1.226151", "-0.73668194", "-0.2813619", "0.7345622", "0.5189411", "-0.7669189", "0.8078956", "0.24483047", "-0.98313695", "1.542142", "0.895852", "1.025212", "0.80999345", "0.110896036", "-0.02370499", "-0.2680321", "0.038271476", "0.5035702", "-0.13963419", "1.4741828", "0.46361762", "-1.0557739", "-0.8522618", "-0.90054446", "-0.017682036", "-0.11748793", "0.41043878", "1.6852674", "-0.25974298", "-0.720682", "0.75527686", "0.89908445", "-0.14935277", "0.50249", "1.02915", "0.85546404", "-0.6617403", "0.022800343", "0.55089784", "-0.74753886", "-1.0490375", "-1.3812634", "-0.038911663", "0.39335802", "1.0485456", "-0.13554399", "0.10001482", "-0.15029708", "-0.32148832", "-0.10703425", "0.064829074", "1.2626235", "-0.03492598", "-0.79104763", "-0.18965444", "0.37750638", "0.7014519", "-0.44280416", "0.75132644", "-2.0333166", "0.24317369", "0.12812501", "-1.3294824", "-0.44460344", "-0.19267277", "1.5095617", "-0.47174713", "0.2758057", "0.7208085", "0.4563103", "-0.5761829", "-0.8898262", "-0.39593256", "0.89246565", "0.9249921", "-1.567785", "0.38366106", "-0.5092053", "-0.43666476", "-0.3457456", "-0.86086065", "-0.50334775", "0.033802565", "-1.2995019", "-0.021859081", "0.78742945", "-0.6421681", "0.49212068", "0.38285288", "-0.21008053", "-0.63287216", "-0.118316084", "0.46418786", "1.6097159", "0.49504405", "-2.057045", "-0.66074693", "0.008762012", "-1.0241758", "0.463434", "0.7219908", "1.1817544", "0.3852503", "0.17169929", "1.2151397", "-0.09693793", "-0.081240594", "1.4230238", "0.2310415", "0.4490939", "0.7376747", "0.44827268", "0.11934591", "0.037353102", "-0.5987149", "0.9931807", "0.08684031", "0.07585191", "-0.08254874", "-0.83080053", "0.8674595", "0.6159947", "0.63029444", "0.5251662", "0.340536", "-0.02765411", "-0.40080905", "1.0211893", "-0.27497107", "0.6246073", "0.067314506", "1.3765571", "0.69484574", "0.0119606005", "0.4201637", "-0.24630693", "0.26954332", "-0.8631282", "-0.4185841", "0.61165166", "0.6633481", "-0.29993746", "0.2041823", "-0.28437614"]}
