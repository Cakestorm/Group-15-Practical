These results demonstrate that the offshore aquaculture noise, and in particular the sea soundscape, adversely influences the oxidative status and the immune function of gilthead sea bream determining a mild stress condition that could affect the sea bream welfare.\n"}]}, "text": "This study evaluated the ambient noise effect of onshore and offshore aquaculture systems on oxidative status and on some immune parameters in gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata) juveniles.
