Recent findings The molecular basis of type 2 (qualitative abnormalities) and type 3 VWD (total quantitative deficiency) have been well characterized in recent decades. However, knowledge of type 1 VWD (partial quantitative deficiency) remains incomplete because of the allelic and locus heterogeneity of this trait, and is complicated by genetic variability at the VWF gene, interactions between the VWF gene and the environment, and the involvement of external modifying loci.
