{"title": "Article 423", "body": "Amphiregulin and epiregulin belong to the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family, and act as mitogenic stimulators via binding to EGF receptors (EGFRs). Amphiregulin and epiregulin are thought to play a role in regenerative responses in the gastrointestinal tract. In this study, we investigated secretion of amphiregulin and epiregulin in human colonic subepithelial myofibroblasts (SEMFs). The mRNA expression and protein secretion of amphiregulin and epiregulin were evaluated by Northern blotting and Western blotting, respectively. The trophic effects of amphiregulin and epiregulin on SEMFs were analyzed by MTT assays. Amphiregulin and epiregulin mRNAs were not detected in unstimulated SEMFs. Among the various cytokines and growth factors, interleukin-1 beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and EGF strongly induced amphiregulin and epiregulin mRNA expression. These responses were markedly reduced by AG1478, a specific inhibitor of EGF receptor tyrosine kinases. Amphiregulin and epiregulin secretion were also detected at the protein level. MTT assays demonstrated that amphiregulin and epiregulin stimulate the proliferation of SEMFs. We demonstrated expression of amphiregulin and epiregulin in SEMFs. Amphiregulin and epiregulin may play an important role in the mechanism underlying wound healing in damaged colonic mucosa.\n", "text": "Amphiregulin and epiregulin belong to the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family, and act as mitogenic stimulators via binding to EGF receptors (EGFRs).
