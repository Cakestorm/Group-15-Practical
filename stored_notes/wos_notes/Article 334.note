{"body": "Keratinocytes (KCs) play a key role in all phases of skin sensitization. We recently identified interleukin-18 (IL-18) production as useful end point for determination of contact sensitization potential of low molecular weight chemicals. The aim of this study was to identify genes involved in skin sensitizer-induced inflammasome activation and to establish their role in IL-18 production. For gene expression analysis, cells were treated for 6 h with p-phenylenediamine (PPD) as reference contact allergen; total RNA was extracted and examined with a commercially available Inflammasome Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) array. Among genes induced, NLRP12 (Nod-like receptor P12) was selected for further investigation. NLRP12 promoter region contains Blimp-1 (B-lymphocyte-induced maturation protein-1)/PRDM1 binding site, and from the literature, it is reported that Blimp-1 reduces NLRP12 activity and expression in monocytes/macrophages. Their expression and role in KCs are currently unknown. To confirm NLRP12 expression and to investigate its relationship with Blimp-1, cells were exposed for different times (3, 6 and 24 h) to the extreme sensitizer 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) and the strong sensitizer PPD. Allergens were able to induce both genes, however, with different kinetic, with DNCB more rapidly upregulating Blimp-1 and inducing IL-18 production, compared to PPD. NLRP12 and Blimp-1 expression appeared to be inversely correlated: Blimp-1 silencing resulted in increased NLRP12 expression and reduced contact allergen-induced IL-18 production. Overall results indicate that contact allergens of different potency differently modulate Blimp-1/NLRP12 expression, with strong allergen more rapidly downregulating NLRP12, thus more rapidly inducing IL-18 production. Data confirm that also in KCs, NLRP12 has an inhibitory effect on inflammasome activation assessed by IL-18 maturation.\n", "embeddings": ["-1.4556478", "0.60743076", "-1.8835081", "-2.64848", "1.1768074", "-2.7725666", "0.29038066", "-0.12569702", "-1.2260095", "0.43739316", "0.7910058", "-2.1633625", "0.6854117", "1.39832", "-1.5114976", "-0.78719693", "1.4876378", "0.48497382", "-0.68090457", "-0.5748891", "0.66828054", "-1.8647025", "0.36645916", "-0.27458298", "-1.1405469", "-0.027809262", "-0.12999058", "0.8025602", "0.13470775", "-1.5020869", "0.19664794", "0.23560248", "0.15359154", "0.21044824", "0.6611862", "-0.27181074", "0.28648046", "-0.9246113", "0.84550506", "-0.91681767", "-1.4468861", "0.4093998", "-0.51500225", "0.057342075", "-0.36541265", "-0.343251", "1.417781", "-0.5191841", "0.59240836", "-1.3412896", "1.2105268", "-1.1757145", "-0.4236987", "-1.0362941", "-0.09807912", "-0.52901983", "-1.663506", "0.73517805", "-0.77515507", "2.098311", "-1.0060601", "-0.70998824", "0.46022832", "1.3241022", "-0.07289107", "0.061627958", "1.6559705", "2.6250582", "-0.82864696", "-1.4864696", "-0.76475734", "0.9264598", "-0.33331886", "0.412316", "-1.0082504", "-0.89242184", "0.17940977", "-1.3838582", "-0.44283083", "0.26301643", "-0.3306372", "-0.30770832", "-0.22197196", "1.1210885", "0.11770932", "0.10744854", "2.3045106", "0.25864297", "-0.574185", "-1.4038187", "0.7714557", "0.2895957", "-0.7191025", "-0.29101703", "0.5905516", "-1.2626987", "0.25559345", "0.69711995", "0.58428395", "-0.7045108", "-1.4305571", "1.6703037", "0.63247585", "0.32395634", "-1.1033374", "-0.34411642", "-1.9650469", "1.8445066", "-0.3673153", "-2.2512562", "0.22861056", "-1.5341909", "0.8444933", "-1.0588315", "0.09674304", "-0.7934072", "0.59014696", "-0.14698134", "1.2497343", "-0.28472835", "-0.006598121", "0.90065736", "-0.098956876", "-0.9398373", "1.1635722", "0.95446706", "-1.6974211", "-1.7080039", "-0.20703027", "-0.48888078", "1.9035283", "-0.599252", "0.36110416", "-1.1636245", "-0.627904", "-0.1619386", "-1.6171458", "0.2152209", "0.13617645", "-0.7272953", "-0.31981796", "-0.5364885", "0.8843467", "-1.1246507", "0.13587892", "0.0425374", "-1.2596602", "0.5269566", "0.043728415", "1.472657", "-0.5401195", "-0.06894044", "-0.4622466", "0.29928607", "-0.27427533", "0.72983426", "0.21070264", "0.3629567", "1.4303749", "-0.19814654", "-0.219637", "-0.09934883", "1.4395517", "1.9192313", "-0.035151128", "-0.42097706", "1.044442", "-0.6700785", "-1.249516", "0.46501693", "-0.07988575", "1.1279296", "0.29296914", "0.5638873", "1.9975514", "-1.521961", "-0.5840125", "1.5147933", "1.8783888", "-1.1675589", "1.1618615", "-0.5143764", "-0.12250326", "2.2817283", "-0.51982605", "0.38454458", "0.09973608", "-0.41056564", "0.6906163", "-0.12895249", "-0.24215475", "0.7966118", "-0.92418915", "2.283538", "0.6709557", "0.06574917", "-0.30133513", "-1.3203582", "0.5733118", "1.7402059"]}
