{"body": "The DNA mismatch repair (MMR) gene MutL homolog 1 (MLH1) is critical for the maintenance of genomic integrity. Methylation of the MLH1 gene promoter was identified as a prognostic marker for numerous types of cancer including glioblastoma, colorectal, ovarian and gastric cancer. The present study aimed to determine whether MLH1 promoter methylation was associated with survival in male patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded ESCC tissues were collected from 87 male patients. MLH1 promoter methylation was assessed using the methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction approach. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and log-rank tests were used to evaluate the association between MLH1 promoter methylation and overall survival (OS) in patients with ESCC. Cox regression analysis was used to obtain crude and multivariate hazard ratios (HR), and 95% confidence intervals (CI). The present study revealed that MLH1 promoter methylation was observed in 53/87 (60.9%) of male patients with ESCC. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated that MLH1 promoter hypermethylation was significantly associated with poorer prognosis in patients with ESCC (P= 0.048). Multivariate survival analysis revealed that MLH1 promoter hypermethylation was an independent predictor of poor OS in male patients with ESCC (HR= 1.716; 95% CI= 1.008-2.921). Therefore, MLH1 promoter hypermethylation may be a predictor of prognosis in male patients with ESCC.\n", "embeddings": ["0.48487687", "-1.9204403", "-0.84405136", "-0.3013311", "0.88376784", "-0.4336357", "0.06612811", "1.535936", "-0.7288691", "-1.4288906", "-0.025131293", "-1.2181482", "0.59444124", "-0.63913304", "-1.4484252", "0.78041345", "0.27372837", "0.45278507", "0.13406634", "-2.6430938", "0.40912357", "-1.6677387", "0.8310727", "0.39444643", "-0.3726899", "-0.2686724", "-0.7950446", "0.9111348", "0.13015226", "0.094935685", "1.1787484", "0.31431818", "0.6441854", "-1.4562312", "-0.2125433", "-0.04708732", "0.8526174", "-1.4955605", "0.61007494", "0.21329197", "-0.048018742", "-0.9603143", "-1.673017", "-1.4827611", "1.0788256", "0.036680594", "0.66125107", "0.24343081", "-0.56437206", "0.1710952", "-0.33149323", "-1.1526847", "-0.6901913", "-0.36321968", "0.7439613", "0.84989256", "-0.93786716", "-0.49999952", "0.053554244", "-0.005928165", "0.5895385", "0.5424583", "0.8649162", "0.9247347", "-1.0261596", "1.7725407", "-0.9033957", "0.4544318", "0.6582209", "1.2885456", "-1.0791137", "0.8233838", "0.41506416", "0.2907345", "-0.23301719", "0.3249092", "-0.11730747", "-0.04700093", "-1.1028595", "0.5253608", "-0.079037294", "-1.1355017", "-0.14709051", "0.4081367", "-0.5397323", "0.007842711", "0.9687203", "0.41241202", "-1.106901", "-0.40041882", "1.1532087", "0.56543005", "0.68173546", "-0.94188243", "0.2732167", "-1.0214412", "-0.2800205", "-0.18715906", "0.92249095", "-0.8013164", "1.3310941", "0.44607037", "0.6739922", "-0.40522712", "0.094823964", "-1.676398", "0.22942343", "0.5392068", "-0.2089405", "-0.6448514", "-1.0462816", "-1.2408466", "0.4687565", "0.6213506", "-0.37550148", "-1.2663902", "-0.18729678", "-1.4617528", "-0.8809818", "-0.7799692", "0.16300234", "-0.36324906", "1.1288928", "-0.009954181", "-0.8948228", "-1.1223389", "-0.43435657", "0.6241001", "-0.30383065", "0.8664171", "1.0755059", "0.015868582", "-0.5128723", "0.5095724", "0.11460149", "1.4601941", "0.7769705", "-1.7861476", "0.80384773", "-0.15062091", "-0.9786139", "-0.24683832", "-0.6530021", "-0.9831597", "0.3450295", "-0.576771", "1.6846895", "0.44445774", "-0.15167964", "0.93103963", "0.18270983", "0.63645893", "-0.2612304", "-1.2231874", "-0.6954561", "0.5321172", "1.4136072", "0.9912538", "0.2931927", "-0.14122538", "1.17331", "0.15550254", "1.3004129", "0.5113156", "-0.7942182", "0.27246", "1.1160116", "-0.28457227", "-1.0854832", "-0.46511525", "0.9641031", "-0.5468611", "0.89408255", "-0.46137646", "0.9999123", "-0.24557832", "-0.79493284", "0.061436776", "1.4562196", "0.15365268", "-0.5467644", "0.90561867", "-0.08768756", "0.0019257914", "1.3116678", "-1.043188", "0.6593816", "0.9547124", "2.7360709", "-0.055544756", "0.6906602", "-0.4026241", "-0.32912883", "0.15425484", "-0.097145244", "-0.8961012", "0.44983613", "-0.31584248", "-0.235095", "0.3889633"]}
