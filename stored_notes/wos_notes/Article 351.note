To perform a state of the art about immunological features in renal transplantation, immunosuppressive drugs and their mechanisms of action and immunologically high risk transplantations such as ABO and HLA-incompatible transplantation.

An exhaustive systematic review of the scientific literature was performed in the Medline database and Embase using different associations of the following keywords (MESH): \"allogenic response; allograft; immunosuppression; ABO incompatible transplantation; donor specific antibodies; HLA incompatible; desensitization; kidney transplantation\". Publications obtained were selected based on methodology, language, date of publication (last 10 years) and relevance.

After reading titles and abstracts, 141 were included in the text, based on their relevance. Results. The considerable step in comprehension and knowledge allogeneic response this last few years allowed a better used of immunosuppression and the discover of news immunosuppressive drugs. In the first part of this article, the allogeneic response will be described. The different classes of immunosuppressive drugs will be presented and the actual management of immunosuppression will be discussed. Eventually, the modalities and results of immunologically high-risk transplantations such as ABO and HLA incompatible transplantations will be reported. Conclusions. The knowledge and the control of allogeneic response to allogeneic graft allowed the development of renal transplantation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.
