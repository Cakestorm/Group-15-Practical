{"title": "Article 479", "body": "Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) is a systemic vasculitis mediated by autologous immune complex. Animal models of HSP are scarce. Here, we describe the characteristics of HSP rabbit model in the acute and recovery phase. First, we constructed the HSP rabbit models, and then assessed immunologic indicators of models by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoturbidimetry. Histomorphological characteristics were analyzed by haematoxylin-eosin, immunofluorescence and special staining. In the acute stage (24 h) after antigen challenge, the model group rabbits featured skin ecchymosis and abnormal laboratory examination results. Three weeks following the allergic reaction, purple spots improved markedly, and edema and blood seeping decreased, but obvious inflammation was present in the skin, kidneys, joints, gastrointestinal, lung and liver. Serological results of CD4, CD/CD8, IL-2, IL-4, and TNF-alpha, IgA, IgG, TropI, Alb and T were still abnormal. IgA and C3 expressed in skin and kidney and eosinophils expressed in skin and lungs were increased. The rabbit model can mimic human HSP lesions in symptoms, pathology, and immunology and may provide valuable insight into the pathogenesis of HSP and serve as a tool for future therapeutic development targeting HSP.\n", "text": "Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) is a systemic vasculitis mediated by autologous immune complex.
