{"title": "Article 2603", "body": "A platform for electrochemical transduction suitable for miniaturised point-of-care diagnostic solutions with intuitive optical read-out was designed. Electrolytic current from electrochemical cell was transduced into the glow of a light-emitting diode. Its performance was optimised and several variants of transducing circuitry were tested. The circuit comprising field-effect transistor (FET) exhibited the sought abilities - absolute simplicity and high and tuneable sensitivity of the transducing device. Limit-of-detection, i.e. a signal readable by naked-eye without any additional instrumentation was as low as 4 mu M for direct assay of H2O2. The whole transducing system employing FET consisted of 4 off-the-shelf components and its price reached <0.3 (sic) even at small-scale experimental production. As our system was rather suitable for the semiquantitative \"YES/NO\" applications due to the steep response curve, an alternative circuitry for widening the linear range was also probed. Finally, rather higher initial voltage that was required in the electrochemical cell for FET-based transducer lead us to design a further simplified and more variable circuit employing the operational amplifier.
