{"body": "A fish egg envelope is composed of several glycoproteins, called zona pellucida (ZP) proteins, which are conserved among vertebrate species. Euteleost fishes synthesize ZP proteins in the liver, while otocephalans synthesize them in the growing oocyte. We investigated ZP proteins of the Japanese eel, Anguilla japonica, belonging to Elopomorpha, which diverged earlier than Euteleostei and Otocephala. Five major components of the egg envelope were purified and their partial amino acid sequences were determined by sequencing. cDNA cloning revealed that the eel egg envelope was composed of four ZPC homologues and one ZPB homologue. Four of the five eel ZP (eZP) proteins possessed a transmembrane domain, which is not found in the ZP proteins of Euteleostei and Otocephala that diverged later, but is found in most other vertebrate ZP proteins. This result suggests that fish ZP proteins originally possessed a transmembrane domain and lost it during evolution. Northern blotting and RT-PCR revealed that all of the eZP transcripts were present in the ovary, but not in the liver. Phylogenetic analyses of fish zp genes showed that ezps formed a group with other fish zp genes that are expressed in the ovary, and which are distinct from the group of genes expressed in the liver. Our results support the hypothesis that fish ZP proteins were originally synthesized in the ovary, and then the site of synthesis was switched to the liver during the evolutionary pathway to Euteleostei.\n", "embeddings": ["1.755059", "-0.91508883", "0.06958055", "-1.8869721", "2.1143575", "0.5929888", "-0.60604656", "0.92944807", "-0.40940192", "0.15323086", "-1.6392642", "0.97294813", "-0.6604931", "0.106261015", "-1.5019084", "-0.31088", "-0.7664393", "-0.21050939", "0.70392764", "-0.94145715", "-0.09962111", "-1.0610596", "1.5959717", "0.183208", "1.0699029", "-2.11668", "-0.7507205", "0.5977159", "-0.7229788", "-0.3037654", "1.0784154", "-1.2797098", "0.24094729", "0.14945695", "0.14172758", "-2.025383", "0.85123104", "-0.63528156", "0.31884393", "-1.1857023", "0.1703327", "-1.1392822", "-0.75189835", "0.0838314", "1.6578052", "-0.3342435", "0.7182179", "-0.23335221", "0.9243843", "-0.16213335", "-1.5564401", "-0.5946589", "-0.35098556", "-0.5966701", "0.73461545", "0.6852781", "0.32426363", "-2.2040093", "-0.54316705", "0.20076452", "0.9513919", "0.4387556", "0.9587326", "-0.5903952", "0.017984072", "-1.0036217", "2.159723", "1.5882245", "-0.4619719", "0.30944836", "0.68773234", "-0.543962", "-0.5778331", "1.7720755", "0.27760988", "0.574871", "-0.3445231", "-0.562492", "-1.4698715", "1.3513057", "-1.3777709", "-2.5612319", "-1.0894202", "0.11146475", "-0.08607249", "0.3100128", "0.3500112", "0.33873832", "-1.7929959", "0.16635302", "0.56790864", "0.9278376", "0.166056", "1.5207354", "1.1217483", "1.1840942", "-1.7188324", "-0.40838802", "0.45983374", "0.86179805", "1.3164572", "-0.8948713", "1.2772913", "0.2281535", "0.30688435", "1.1833637", "0.48989198", "-0.096035406", "0.30522984", "0.86427903", "-0.6601703", "-1.2703494", "0.22496387", "-2.2125814", "-0.8305698", "0.94608366", "-0.20747243", "1.4124098", "-0.44687614", "-1.7863517", "0.20365377", "0.6420173", "1.0711414", "-0.543112", "0.29036203", "0.066331506", "1.2353717", "-0.4370443", "-1.3165609", "-0.6090034", "1.9634287", "0.92510426", "0.77205175", "0.108779944", "0.17382427", "1.2331887", "-1.5009915", "-0.9641477", "-2.0056562", "-1.2687584", "1.2215028", "-0.4513051", "-0.2171657", "0.98914754", "-0.003785929", "-0.21406686", "-1.8850528", "0.5253166", "-0.19409956", "-0.2919523", "-0.52052855", "-0.15058541", "0.4464917", "-0.16288236", "0.37460315", "1.3874179", "0.18499109", "0.38073125", "0.084577955", "-0.8069428", "0.2672124", "0.21546163", "1.3538023", "-0.59358513", "-0.021456005", "-0.42924327", "1.9740347", "-1.0451503", "-0.65303475", "0.09728964", "-0.41255108", "-0.38166255", "-0.07062452", "1.2346987", "-1.0533394", "-0.90244836", "-0.6740746", "-0.72138065", "0.65624297", "1.3515856", "-2.2917154", "-1.0903114", "0.9717262", "0.9912374", "1.379822", "0.3547705", "0.29435286", "0.653004", "1.2637134", "-0.705731", "0.09729152", "0.53702897", "-0.20603089", "-1.1270419", "1.5698076", "1.2496928", "0.35841325", "-1.1391945", "-0.6284015", "-0.105879396"]}
