A fully disposable chemically-heated thermal processor is developed to heat the capillary tube from the bottom at a fixed temperature for amplification without the need for electrical power. Amplification is achieved when reagents in the capillary tube are spontaneously and repeatedly transported through different temperature zones, which significantly shortens the amplification time by eliminating the need for controlled time-domain temperature cycling.
