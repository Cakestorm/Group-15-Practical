{"body": "Embryo implantation is a complex initial step in establishment of a successful pregnancy. Many mRNAs have been shown to be differentially expressed in the rat uterus during embryo implantation. However, the expression profiles of microRNAs (miRNAs), a key post-transcriptional regulator of gene expression, in the rat uterus between the pre-receptive and receptive phases are still unknown. Here, an miRNA microarray was used to examine differential expression of miRNAs in the rat uterus between the pre-receptive and receptive phases. Twenty-eight miRNAs were up-regulated and 29 miRNAs were down-regulated at least twofold during the receptive phase in rat uterus; these results were confirmed by Northern blotting. miR-29a was only highly expressed in rat uterus during the implantation period, and activation of delayed implantation and artificial decidualization enhanced the miR-29a level. Further investigation revealed that both the pro-apoptotic factor genes Bak1 and Bmf and the anti-apoptotic factor gene Bcl-w are targets of miR-29a. There was weak binding between miR-29a and the 3 UTR of the anti-apoptotic factor gene Mcl1. Over-expression of miR-29a inhibited the late apoptosis of endometrial stromal cells, which may be due to the stronger binding capacity between miR-29a and the 3 UTR of pro-apoptotic factors than that between miR-29a and the 3 UTR of anti-apoptotic factors. Collectively, miR-29a plays an important role during embryo implantation by regulating both pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic factors. miR-29a may predominantly bind pro-apoptotic factors, leading to inhibition of cell apoptosis.\n", "embeddings": ["-0.08437487", "-0.26349977", "-1.0697197", "-0.017685799", "-0.2790381", "-0.20268473", "1.0013658", "0.9182485", "-0.6074532", "-0.4337103", "0.20968416", "1.2785594", "0.35233083", "-0.4452208", "-1.1429222", "0.0065727965", "0.2884551", "0.5375833", "0.23536739", "-2.1378696", "0.8553019", "-1.6658194", "0.86526686", "-0.49462354", "1.7528036", "0.38865727", "0.14944065", "-0.3397321", "-0.49012128", "0.20384082", "0.61473054", "-0.6311473", "-1.2283146", "0.046416182", "-0.27926943", "0.15658027", "0.19264403", "0.18465658", "0.30594978", "0.72953993", "-0.21730925", "0.09865919", "-1.1582115", "-0.0109215975", "0.46314487", "0.5751375", "0.7808996", "-1.7298957", "1.1317989", "2.0694892", "-0.5778863", "-1.7084262", "-0.011091707", "-0.33405152", "0.92319477", "1.0697838", "-0.55447763", "0.20358698", "-1.9849759", "1.0054798", "0.3829643", "1.9903269", "0.104742564", "0.3533391", "0.78865534", "1.6659338", "0.93476003", "2.1569142", "-0.15915759", "0.06692652", "-1.9929918", "1.1206509", "-0.08296761", "-0.25619802", "1.8449126", "1.0157942", "0.66714483", "-0.82054305", "-0.21938741", "1.1052659", "-0.9431741", "-1.6269774", "-1.4247162", "0.15625931", "-3.1305394", "-0.35794297", "0.42006436", "-0.29363987", "0.12037303", "-0.075392306", "1.6593909", "1.1851282", "0.21163438", "-0.43532905", "-0.72601676", "0.51213604", "-0.40973434", "-1.3519713", "-0.07625582", "0.023889197", "-1.6865084", "0.4801168", "1.4493228", "-0.9128192", "0.48992553", "-1.3078538", "-0.39018303", "-1.0047603", "-0.21194586", "-1.1929884", "-0.712478", "-0.6123331", "-0.019328108", "-0.83405536", "0.88976544", "-1.2812893", "0.77746636", "-0.46746907", "0.14388433", "0.06431678", "-0.32424632", "-0.03784003", "-0.005657136", "-0.46177703", "0.21271789", "-0.25780702", "-0.86014634", "-0.057075594", "-0.73409075", "0.18258235", "1.0436307", "0.16820557", "-0.7759391", "-0.14672416", "-0.19119385", "-0.6472842", "-2.4759269", "-0.27835265", "-0.47530034", "0.011044767", "1.0167162", "-1.0540175", "1.0097911", "0.61676747", "0.19747798", "0.015402083", "-0.6853776", "-0.75154203", "-0.2772093", "0.9483853", "-0.4347576", "-0.47924513", "-0.77325314", "0.2439214", "-0.68828696", "-0.43708342", "0.5849453", "-0.19271252", "0.74469215", "1.0948753", "0.056750756", "0.30144748", "1.2848095", "0.20919637", "0.2336921", "0.5801242", "0.35727385", "1.0974699", "-1.7239938", "-0.02201628", "-0.38056824", "-0.6744763", "-0.009271229", "1.054196", "0.96695244", "-3.2479107", "-0.51937217", "-0.33271638", "0.1748303", "1.879399", "-1.0661881", "0.33596206", "0.61559165", "-0.49480334", "0.3622448", "-1.1618665", "-0.5041906", "0.19694373", "1.9707644", "0.60277015", "0.6187352", "0.26797217", "0.589053", "0.0054236157", "0.9900648", "-0.10288173", "0.5388009", "-0.75527287", "-1.0172883", "-0.8161654"]}
