{"title": "Article 1030", "body": "AimsThe aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a real-time PCR technology for microbiological control methods to examine individualized cell therapeutics, an emerging class of pharmaceutical formulations. Methods and ResultsOligonucleotide primers and hybridization probe for bacterial detection targeting the 16SrRNA gene were adapted based on Nadkarni etal. [Microbiology148 (2002) 257]. For detection of yeast and moulds, primers and probe were designed from conserved sequences of the 18SrRNA gene in this study. The real-time PCR assays were tested on genomic DNA of Escherichia coli and Candida albicans to assess efficiency and linear dynamic range. After successful establishment of robust real-time PCRs, applicability of the assays was evaluated by extracting microbial target DNA from cell-based preparations. Different commercial DNA extraction methods were compared identifying the MagNA Pure DNA Isolation Kit III as the method of choice. Sensitivity was examined for different strains and a detection limit of 10(2)-10(3) CFU per ml in a sample containing similar to 10(6) mammalian cells per ml was achieved. ConclusionsThis study reports the successful establishment of two qualitative real-time PCR assays, enabling in general the broad-range detection of microbial contaminants in a cell-based sample matrix. Significance and Impact of the StudyIndividualized cell therapeutics tend to have a short shelf life. Due to lengthy incubation periods, compendial testing according to current pharmacopoeial guidelines may not be applicable. We report a suitable alternative method upon which future microbiological quality control methods for such products could be based on. However, to implement valid rapid microbiological testing methods using real-time PCR technology, further challenges need to be addressed.\n", "text": "AimsThe aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a real-time PCR technology for microbiological control methods to examine individualized cell therapeutics, an emerging class of pharmaceutical formulations.
