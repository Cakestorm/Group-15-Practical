{"title": "Article 1500", "body": "Child maltreatment most often occurs within the family and is often an expression of the inability of parents to cope with the child's needs. Parental distress results in inadequate, conscious or unconscious but never accidental overreactions, resulting in severe physical and psychological sequelae. Furthermore, the individual and healthcare costs to society are extensive; therefore, early identification of children and adolescents at risk is of paramount importance and due to the position of trust in relationship to families, pediatricians play an important role. The recommended preventive medical check-ups are regular contacts, which provide the opportunity for early recognition of child maltreatment and implementation of measures to prevent further harm. Knowledge of risk factors, potential triggers and availability of community programs and resources to help affected families are indispensable prerequisites.\n", "text": "Child maltreatment most often occurs within the family and is often an expression of the inability of parents to cope with the child's needs.
