Extra-discursive elements related to the physical body, resource distribution, and funding policy were examined for their interaction with discursive patterns. ImplicatiOns of findings include addressing issues in the current approach to responding to child abuse (e.g., uniting around common definitions of abuse; refining parameters for when FME is helpful; shoring up material resources for the abuse response infrastructure) and considering modification of providers' roles and activities relative to forensic work (e.g., deploying providers for prevention activities versus reactive activities).
