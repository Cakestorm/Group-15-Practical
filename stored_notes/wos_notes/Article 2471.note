Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and X-ray single crystal structure reveal that TTO has a highly twisted conformation and unique D-pi-A structure which render it exceptional optical properties. TTO exhibits strong fluorescence in methanol (QE>0.67) but weak fluorescence in other organic solvents (QE<0.1) including various alcohols and can be used as a highly selective fluorescence probe for methanol identification.
