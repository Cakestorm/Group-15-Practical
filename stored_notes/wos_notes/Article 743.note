Herein, we demonstrated that Au(III) catalysts can be stabilized against reduction to metallic Au by modifying supported-ionic-liquid-phase-stabilized Au(III) catalyst with CuCl2. It was found that the that reduced Au could be re -oxidized in situ to Au3+ species by CuCl2 during the reaction and further stabilized by the electron transfer from Cu to these active species. When evaluated in the acetylene hydrochlorination reaction, the Au-Cu-IL/AC catalyst displayed an excellent specific activity with the turnover frequency (TOF) as high as 168.5 h(-1) and more than 99.8% selectivity fot the product, vinyl chloride (VCM). Furthermore, the Au-Cu-IL/AC catalyst demonstrated a stable catalytic performance with a negligible loss of C2H2 conversion after 500 h under typical industrial reaction conditions for acetylene hydrochlorination. Therefore, the findings of this work provide an efficient approach for designing stable high-valent metals for long-term operation, and also pave the way for the application of Au-Cu-IL/AC catalyst in industrial VCM production.
