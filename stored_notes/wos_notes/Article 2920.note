{"body": "AIM: To study the expression of collagen I and transcription factor specificity protein 1 (Sp1), a transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) downstream target, and reveal the impact of the TGF-beta 1-Sp1 signaling pathway on collagen remodeling in myopic sclera. METHODS: Seventy-five 1-week-old guinea pigs were randomly divided into normal control, form deprivation myopia (FDM), and self-control groups. FDM was induced for different times using coverage with translucent latex balloons and FDM recovery was performed for 1wk after 4wk treatment; then, changes in refractive power and axial length were measured. Immunohistochemistry and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction were used to evaluate dynamic changes in collagen I and Sp1 expression in the sclera of guinea pigs with emmetropia and experimental myopia, and the relationship between collagen I and Sp1 levels was analyzed. RESULTS: In the FDM group, the refractive power was gradually changed (from 2.09 +/- 0.30 D at week 0 to -1.23 +/- 0.69 D, -4.17 +/- 0.59 D, -7.07 +/- 0.56 D, and -4.30 +/- 0.58 D at weeks 2, 4, 6, and 1wk after 4wk, respectively; P<0.05), indicating deepening of myopia. The axial length was increased (from 5.92 +/- 0.39 mm at week 0 to 6.62 +/- 0.36 mm, 7.30 +/- 0.34 mm, 7.99 +/- 0.32 mm, and 7.41 +/- 0.36 mm at weeks 2, 4, 6, and 1wk after 4wk; P<0.05). The mRNA and protein expression of Sp1 and collagen I in the sclera of the FDM group was lower than that of the control groups (P<0.05), and the reduction was eye-coverage time-dependent. Furthermore, correlation between Sp1 and collagen I down-regulation in the myopic sclera was observed. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that transcription factor Sp1 may be involved in the regulation of type I collagen synthesis/degradation during myopic sclera remodeling, suggesting that TGF-beta 1 signaling plays a role in the development and progression of myopia.\n", "embeddings": ["0.89832646", "-2.5552824", "0.4870707", "-0.85072315", "1.5041189", "-0.6637734", "-0.5277256", "4.106749", "-1.934217", "0.5160957", "0.5327558", "0.54648256", "-0.9221151", "1.1373632", "-1.1627116", "-0.2682531", "-0.47736824", "0.13619095", "-1.636349", "-1.1266764", "0.86164176", "1.1824431", "-1.4285121", "0.42984754", "1.4807858", "-0.79738104", "-0.33673668", "1.1043342", "-1.7208034", "-1.8671921", "2.0003738", "0.50675285", "0.8021514", "0.21092588", "-1.0574263", "0.5150628", "-1.3751202", "-0.24394819", "0.5852569", "-0.4892862", "-0.47015887", "-0.4000462", "0.9906432", "0.77683663", "-0.4913061", "0.42941606", "0.59430563", "0.7790509", "1.2671175", "1.1242532", "1.4002436", "-0.75072783", "-0.49526548", "-1.7439457", "-0.3220135", "0.11864389", "0.12856092", "0.9629363", "-0.13164724", "0.40533772", "0.6005532", "-0.4226621", "1.0443608", "0.50191146", "0.06254114", "1.5407809", "-0.81740093", "-1.3110528", "0.17156999", "0.87346977", "0.7211208", "0.7322887", "0.9972621", "0.94773084", "0.05763026", "0.4672001", "1.3985548", "-0.9425971", "-0.6045161", "-0.7339646", "0.5557723", "-1.9687179", "0.40905124", "2.1247213", "0.31265527", "-0.6693534", "-0.038942423", "0.35404292", "-0.79601055", "0.41209662", "0.8222235", "0.72228086", "-0.69193316", "0.16967054", "1.2505935", "0.37761045", "0.90401655", "-0.41509932", "0.6628354", "1.133156", "0.5715453", "1.7729342", "-0.36405456", "0.30813065", "-2.4006693", "0.09523141", "-0.10954201", "2.0741007", "0.50709933", "0.1446845", "-1.6197293", "-0.41316843", "0.28936243", "0.30562335", "0.64734876", "-1.3252776", "1.464502", "-1.2540741", "-0.45015323", "0.6657515", "-1.5601829", "0.29962316", "1.8457373", "0.34569508", "1.8203706", "0.77123463", "0.5679128", "-0.042000163", "-0.9374878", "0.45517996", "1.040892", "-0.58598757", "-1.9297905", "-0.7435957", "-0.6336004", "0.2358466", "-0.37645325", "0.6732971", "-0.4146022", "0.83359706", "1.2499171", "0.6368027", "-0.4087696", "-0.74267286", "1.0021554", "0.71690303", "0.2678261", "-0.8507056", "-0.03145478", "2.13577", "0.95289224", "-0.8233621", "-1.158931", "0.4675076", "-1.124429", "-1.2722185", "1.0833192", "0.51521987", "1.0038997", "0.551408", "0.42804965", "0.9613271", "0.87039787", "1.1456803", "-0.49409008", "-0.089421004", "0.8377542", "1.1656007", "-0.33245093", "0.30971876", "-0.8828669", "0.41428366", "-0.8715941", "-1.1072288", "0.052794125", "-1.3257842", "0.79415536", "-0.72926885", "0.90981996", "0.45920557", "-1.3326043", "-1.4259158", "1.5985354", "0.16961609", "0.8217419", "-0.6975068", "-0.27104968", "1.0932919", "1.4841223", "-1.9368697", "1.4697751", "-0.14467402", "-0.009682001", "-0.22278945", "-0.3319223", "0.21736202", "1.6248786", "-0.875352", "-0.7440015", "-0.31721288"]}
