Newly identified transcript was found to be expressed across different tissues we studied and in different developmental stages. Expression level of novel and reported transcripts was studied using quantitative real-time PCR. After conceptually translating the novel transcript, various post-translational modifications were studied. Translation efficiency and predicted half life of encoded protein isoforms were analysed in silico. Molecular modelling was performed to compare the structural differences in both isoforms. The diversity at N-termini in these protein isoforms explains the diverse function of ABCC4 in mouse. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.
