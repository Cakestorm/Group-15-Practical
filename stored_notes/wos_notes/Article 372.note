{"title": "Article 372", "body": "Abcc4 gene codes for a protein (ABCC4) involved in the transportation of different classes of drugs outside the cells. Various important drugs transported by ABCC4 include antiviral and anticancer drugs as well as endogenous molecules such as bile acids, cyclic nucleotides, folates, prostaglandins and steroids. Alternative splicing generates multiple mRNAs that encode protein isoforms having diverse functions. In this study, we have identified a novel transcript of mouse Abcc4 gene using a combination of bioinformatics and molecular biology techniques. This transcript was found to be different from the reported transcript in having a different first exon that was found to be located on previously identified first intron. Newly identified transcript was found to be expressed across different tissues we studied and in different developmental stages. Expression level of novel and reported transcripts was studied using quantitative real-time PCR. After conceptually translating the novel transcript, various post-translational modifications were studied. Translation efficiency and predicted half life of encoded protein isoforms were analysed in silico. Molecular modelling was performed to compare the structural differences in both isoforms. The diversity at N-termini in these protein isoforms explains the diverse function of ABCC4 in mouse. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.
