{"title": "Article 1995", "body": "Enzymatic treatments have gained recognition in textile industry because they are stereo specific, nontoxic, environment friendly and energy conserving alternatives. Enzymes are virtually applicable to all manufacturing steps of textile chemical processing. Amylases for textile desizing; cellulases employed for bio-polishing & denim washing; proteases for wool modifications are important to mention in this category. However in spite of lot potentials, enzymes have limited industrial acceptance due to extreme pH and temperature conditions employed in textile processing leading to their reduced properties and action. Advances in enzymology and molecular biology provide possibilities for new enzymes identification and modifications in existing enzymes as well as in enzyme-based processes suitable/to fit for environment friendly option. Enzyme immobilization is one such approach which stabilizes enzymes, extends useful life and improves action in some cases too. Additionally, recyclability & reuse of enzymes make process even more economical. This review summarizes the potential research involved in the development of enzymatic processing in textile chemical processing. The paper highlights the significance and limitations of native enzymes as well as immobilized enzymes applications in textile chemical industry. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
