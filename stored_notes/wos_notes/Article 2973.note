{"title": "Article 2973", "body": "This paper focuses on dynamic modeling, simulation and control of Advanced Automatic Pumping Station with Canal Level Remote Control System using ABB PLC (Programmable Logical Controller) based Fuzzy Logic Controller. The system is designed for the agricultural land where the water level (i.e. canals or rivers) is low and traditional system of irrigation is not working well. System is automated through two different controllers, first controller automate the water reservoir gate according to the upper and lower limits of reservoir level and second controller dealt with speed of two pumps with respect to the set point of water level in canal. For controlling, monitoring and real time visualization of a system, HMI (Humane Interface Machine -CP 405) is connected. The applied control method is based on Fuzzy Logic System, designed in MATLAB Simulink, which can communicate with PLC through OPC server by using gateway. Through GPRS based system communication is done between PLC and canal water level meter. A digital control unit PLC (AC500 PM556-ETH) gets data from the system, take the require actions and make decision to operate the pumping station. Simulation results show that system can effectively operate in both, automatic as well as manual conditions depending on selection switch.\n", "text": "This paper focuses on dynamic modeling, simulation and control of Advanced Automatic Pumping Station with Canal Level Remote Control System using ABB PLC (Programmable Logical Controller) based Fuzzy Logic Controller.
