In E. coli ATCC 25922, cadA and cadB mediate the lysine decarboxylation consumed the extra protons inside and keep the neutral pH value in cytoplasm to protect the E. coli from death. In contrast, oxidation-reduction mediated by ahpC, which was activated by the depression of oxyR, and hydrogenation mediated by mhpA consumed the protons inside keeping the neutral pH value to protect the EHEC 0157:H7 from harm induced by a low pH environment.
