Patients and Methods: We measured and confirmed the expression of CD44st and MMP2 mRNAs and proteins in the cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues of postoperative non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with either adenocarcinoma (n = 72) or squamous cell carcinoma (n = 53) using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, gene sequencing, and immunohistochemical analysis. Results: CD44st and MMP2 expression were closely associated with the histopathological classification, lymph node metastasis, and TNM stage of the tumors, and the difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05). The median overall survival (OS) for the high CD44st expression group was 30.52 months (95% confidence interval (Cl) 24.02-36.15); for the low expression group it was 43.23 months (95% Cl 31.81-52.02) (p = 0.020). The median OS for the high MMP-2 expression group was 30.53 months (95% Cl 26.69-33.31); for the low expression group it was 40.06 months (95% Cl 33.55-46.45) (p = 0.022). Conclusion: The rates of CD44st and MMP2 expression were higher in squamous cell carcinomas than in adenocarcinomas, were closely associated with lymph node metastasis and TNM stage, and affected patients' prognoses.
