{"title": "Article 2713", "body": "Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness worldwide and is usually diagnosed in higher age groups. The goal was to survey how patient age influences the development of glaucoma. A web-based search on aging of the visual system and its influence on glaucoma was performed and the most important results are summarized. The prevalence of glaucoma rises with age. Aging processes of the trabecular meshwork and the uveoscleral outflow pathway lead to a rise in the intraocular pressure. Chronically elevated intraocular pressure leads to remodelling of the lamina cribrosa and narrowing of its pores through which ganglion cell axons leave the eye. Age-dependent glia cell, mitochondria and immune system alterations are discussed to influence glaucoma. Patient age and further age-related nonophthalmological systemic diseases also influence adherence and persistence to the prescribed therapy. Aging is an important risk factor for developing glaucoma and is a main factor which influences therapy and course of the disease. At this point in time it remains unclear to which extent additional factors determine the development of glaucoma.\n", "text": "Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness worldwide and is usually diagnosed in higher age groups.
