{"body": "ObjectiveThe aim of this study was to explore the preferred acculturation strategies adopted by Indian subcontinental adolescents living in Australia. The study also examined the demographic, ethnocultural, and psychological factors that could influence subcontinental migrant groups' attitudes towards acculturation and their acculturation strategies. MethodA cross-sectional design was used in which the dependent variables were the four acculturation strategies. Multivariate data analysis was conducted. Pearson's correlation, analysis of variance, and step-wise multiple regression analyses were performed to establish the relationships among the study variables. ResultsIntegration was the most preferred strategy and marginalisation was the least preferred strategy for all ethnic groups. Acculturation preferences are predicted partly by the adolescents' ethnicity, their ethnic identity, friendship choices, acculturative stress, sense of mastery (self-concept) and gender. The findings provide significant information on the acculturation practices of Indian subcontinental adolescents, including their ethnic identity search and commitment, their psychological well-being and their integration strategies. ConclusionsEducational institutions could benefit from increased awareness of the needs of these culturally diverse groups, especially if this information is incorporated into teacher training materials. The inclusion of intercultural relations courses in the academic curriculum would promote harmonious relations between culturally diverse ethnic groups.\n", "embeddings": ["-0.13558991", "-1.6245248", "-0.030901225", "1.7040681", "0.011203238", "0.41117367", "0.069104716", "2.228578", "-0.946798", "-0.5280607", "-0.9091172", "-0.8291576", "-0.07135091", "-0.74939674", "-1.1075703", "-0.120786116", "0.16200267", "-0.45619434", "-0.33237332", "-1.8237914", "0.5425857", "-0.65392596", "-0.7971919", "1.0025679", "0.56470627", "0.600251", "-0.4572623", "-1.6371422", "-1.7712616", "0.0051244097", "1.0903035", "0.22727233", "1.4909862", "0.0036977923", "-0.10383023", "0.17603631", "-1.6534758", "-0.26864505", "0.7005897", "-1.9081024", "-2.2754374", "0.3676631", "0.85892457", "-1.6336094", "-0.9640971", "-1.0550582", "-0.54238254", "-0.31670615", "0.8738169", "-1.5147755", "-0.27853516", "-2.001375", "-0.46292943", "-1.4488059", "0.061441794", "0.7574331", "0.3215277", "1.7806487", "-0.44914344", "1.428365", "0.64598095", "1.1567987", "0.5578654", "0.3147306", "-0.8175289", "0.47345674", "0.019825747", "0.10303276", "-1.2427827", "0.6641058", "-0.121003166", "0.124938995", "0.11234357", "0.89012325", "1.0073276", "-1.2173916", "1.0986457", "0.16449359", "-0.54404235", "-1.3883504", "-0.25142154", "-0.7358335", "0.03336536", "0.9370788", "-1.1682487", "0.4921554", "0.21637113", "-0.388084", "-0.19650917", "-0.019549333", "0.49692178", "0.11635454", "1.6918015", "0.7510355", "0.18753375", "1.0526369", "-0.17938825", "0.2734958", "0.5782592", "0.6178737", "-0.18965033", "-0.29139838", "-1.2021642", "-1.3977042", "0.2587368", "-0.6585392", "0.2443106", "-1.0616769", "0.18053767", "0.028961781", "1.3322582", "-0.33767796", "-0.64450365", "-0.5484862", "0.2754799", "0.14455977", "0.65917355", "-2.445483", "-0.16742972", "-0.25627038", "-0.08198741", "0.7450574", "-0.69433284", "2.1734748", "-1.3777226", "2.1960812", "-0.18604185", "-0.50726587", "-0.12361366", "-0.20658053", "1.635831", "-0.23041314", "-0.9130098", "-0.5158825", "0.56921303", "1.2435114", "-0.635248", "1.0272716", "-0.35917762", "-1.4776363", "-1.4959911", "1.8994445", "-0.24195921", "-1.5334125", "-0.8544732", "0.711644", "-0.31809178", "1.3763859", "1.0402998", "-0.05690425", "-0.17997961", "-0.9427534", "-0.19700037", "-0.32965153", "-1.1576717", "0.49647513", "0.40306133", "0.24067459", "-0.123115204", "1.1131805", "0.3169059", "1.1853489", "0.99348086", "-0.4697888", "0.13973951", "1.2867373", "0.6142385", "-0.8930941", "-0.46143985", "-0.45173168", "-0.105512366", "0.6919421", "1.9515514", "0.93556416", "0.07357876", "-0.17613262", "0.70158505", "0.052707415", "-1.2061814", "0.03729865", "-0.16312133", "1.6112001", "0.31782734", "0.75964904", "0.34158897", "-0.64409035", "0.23379982", "0.8147402", "0.13167372", "-0.09289949", "0.50383", "1.4350016", "0.34814444", "-0.82643956", "0.24114013", "0.5484133", "-0.6324747", "0.031749554", "-1.3461373", "-0.21423328"]}
