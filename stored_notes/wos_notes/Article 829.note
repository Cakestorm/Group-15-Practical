{"title": "Article 829", "body": "To isolate and identify DNA-binding protein(s) with affinity for the mobile chromosomal repeat element bcr1 in Bacillus cereus group bacteria. A biotinylated bcr1 element was immobilized to streptavidin-coated magnetic beads and used to pull out a 20 kDa DNA-binding protein from a whole cell protein extract of B. cereus ATCC 14579. The protein was identified as the product of ORF 2 encoded by the bacteriophage-related autonomously replicating linear genetic element pBClin15 carried by the strain. DNA binding was not bcr1-specific. By Northern blotting ORF 2 was co-transcribed with ORF 1, and also in certain instances with ORF 3 by transcriptional readthrough of the terminator located between ORF 2 and ORF 3. ORF 2 from pBClin15 encodes a DNA-binding protein. ORF 2 is co-transcribed with its upstream gene ORF 1, and in a subset of the transcripts also with the downstream gene ORF 3 through alternative transcription termination. The B. cereus group contains bacterial species of medical and economic importance. Bacteriophages or phage-encoded proteins from these bacteria have been suggested as potential therapeutic agents. Understanding the biology of bacteriophage-related genetic elements through functional characterization of their genes is of high relevance.\n", "text": "To isolate and identify DNA-binding protein(s) with affinity for the mobile chromosomal repeat element bcr1 in Bacillus cereus group bacteria.
