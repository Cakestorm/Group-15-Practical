This study aimed to explore the distribution of these 2 ASC populations in the palatine tonsils of Bactrian camels of different ages. Eighteen Bactrian camels were divided into the following three age groups: pubertal (3-5 years), middle-aged (6-16 years) and old (17-20 years). SIgA and IgG ASCs within different sites of the palatine tonsils were observed through histological and immunohistochemical techniques, and their densities were analyzed using statistical methods. The results from all age groups showed that both the SIgA and IgG ASCs were primarily distributed in the subepithelial compartments of the reticulated crypt epithelium and secondarily distributed in the subepithelial compartments of the stratified surface squamous epithelium, with a few ASCs located in the extrafollicular region. Their densities in these three areas were significantly decreased in turn (P<0.05). However, the densities of SIgA ASCs were significantly higher than IgG ASCs in the same regions (P<0.05), and the densities of both ASC populations decreased with age. The results confirmed that Bactrian camel palatine tonsils are the primary mucosal immune organ producing SIgA ASCs, and the subepithelial compartment of the reticulated crypt epithelium is the primary region for the colonization and functional activity of SIgA and IgG ASCs.\n"}]}, "text": "Secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) are the major effector cells of mucosal immunity, and immunoglobulin G (IgG) ASCs are also associated with mucosal immunity.
