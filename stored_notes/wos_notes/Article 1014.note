{"title": "Article 1014", "body": "Introduction: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cancer (PDAC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Recently, two chemotherapy regimens have proven to improve median overall survival in comparison with gemcitabine. Based on better understanding of tumor molecular biology and of the role of tumor microenvironment, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) could be an interesting and new type of targeted treatment of PDAC. Areas covered: Preclinical and clinical trials have evaluated the efficacy of several mAbs in pancreatic cancer treatment. This review will underline the most important targeted pathways by mAbs involved in this disease, including EGFR, HER-2, IGF-1 R, VEGF/VEGFR, NOTCH, WNT and immune checkpoints. Expert opinion: Despite the promising results of preclinical and phase I trials, the addition of mAbs to standard chemotherapy or in association with other target agents seems not to confirm these results in the following phase II and III trials in pancreatic cancer patients. However, an improved patient selection before treatment based on molecular characteristics in association with reliable predictive biomarkers can identified more efficacious treatment approaches, minimizing toxicity profile of these drugs.\n", "text": "Introduction: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cancer (PDAC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer death worldwide.
