{"title": "Article 2732", "body": "Molt-inhibiting hormone (MIH), a member of the crustacean hyperglycemic hormone (CHH) family, inhibits the synthesis of ecdysteroid in Y-organ (YO) and plays a significant role in the regulation of molting and growth of crustaceans. A complete cDNA sequence encoding MIH (Ers-MIH, GenBank Accession No.: DQ341280) was cloned from eyestalk of Chinese mitten crab (Eriocheir sinensis) by 5' and 3' RACEs and PCR cloning. The full-length cDNA consists of 1457 bp with a 330 bp open reading frame, encoding 110 amino acids, containing a 75 amino acid mature peptide. The deduced amino acid sequence contains a typical CHH domain. Transcripts of Ers-MIH mRNA were detected in eyestalk by Northern blotting. The production of purified recombinant Ers-MIH (rErs-MIH) expressed in Escherichia coli was 0.3 g/L. The LC-ESI-MS analysis showed that two peptide fragments of the recombinant protein were identical to the deduced amino acid sequence of Ers-MIH. By in vitro assay on E. sinensis YOs, a cGMP mediated suppression of rErs-MIH on ecdysteroidogenesis could be observed. Accumulation of cGMP in YOs showed a concentration-dependent manner within 0.01-1 nmol/mL of rErs-MIH; ecdysteroid secretion was inhibited significantly at the range of 0.01-100 nmol/mL rErs-MIH; furthermore, a significant inhibition effect on ecdysteroid releasing was shown when cGMP analog (8-Br-cGMP) concentration rose up to 100 nmol/mL. This study would facilitate to investigate the roles of MIH in molt cycle regulation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
