In this study, we investigated the susceptibility of clonal ginbuna strains to CyHV-2 and the effect of high water temperature treatment on infected ginbuna and goldfish. Experimental intraperitoneal infection with CyHV-2 at 25 degrees C caused 100% mortality in ginbuna strains, which was accompanied by histopathological changes typical of HVHN. Both infected ginbuna S3n strain and goldfish, exposed to high temperature for 6 days [shifting from 25 degrees C (permissive) to 34 degrees C (non-permissive)], showed reduced mortalities after the 1st inoculation, and subsequent 2nd virus challenge to 0%, indicating induction of immunity. It was concluded that ginbuna showed a similar susceptibility and disease development in CyHV-2 infection compared to goldfish, suggesting that ginbuna can be a useful fish model for the study of CyHV-2 infection and immunity.\n"}]}, "text": "Herpesviral haematopoietic necrosis (HVHN), caused by cyprinid herpesvirus-2 (CyHV-2), has affected the commercial production of the goldfish Carassius auratus and gibelio carp Carassius auratus gibelio.
