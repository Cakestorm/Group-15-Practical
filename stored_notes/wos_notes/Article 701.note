In this study, we evaluated the chemosensitive role of astragaloside IV in non-small cell lung cancer cells. Cell Counting Kit-8 analysis was performed to determine cell viability. Real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blot were used to measure the messenger RNA and protein expression. Results showed that astragaloside IV treatment could suppress the proliferation of non-small cell lung cancer cells. In addition, combined treatment with astragaloside IV remarkably enhanced the chemosensitivity to gefitinib in three non-small cell lung cancer cell lines including NCI-H1299, HCC827, and A549. Furthermore, compared with gefitinib-treated cells, the messenger RNA expression of SIRT6 was obviously increased in non-small cell lung cancer cells treated with gefitinib combined with astragaloside IV. In addition, downregulation of SIRT6 was accomplished using small interference RNA technology. As a result, SIRT6 inhibition abolished the sensitization role of astragaloside IV in non-small cell lung cancer cells.
