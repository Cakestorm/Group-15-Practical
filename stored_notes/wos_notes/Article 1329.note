This study aimed to investigate the polymorphisms of GSTP1 rs1695 locus and ABCC2 rs717620 locus, and the sensitivity of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to platinum drugs in a Xinjiang Uygur population. Material/Methods: The gene polymorphisms of GSTP1 rs1695 and ABCC2 rs717620 of Uygur NSCLC patients were assessed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). The relationship between the prognosis of advanced NSCLC Uygur patients and the gene polymorphisms of GSTP1 rs1695 and ABCC2 rs717620 was analyzed using progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) as the major outcome indicators. Results: The median PFS of patients with advanced NSCLC was 6.9 months and the OS of Uygur patients with advanced NSCLC was 10.8 months. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicated that survival time of patients with GSTP1 AG + GG was significantly longer than in patients with AA gene (P<0.05), and survival time of patients with ABCC2 CT + TT was significantly longer than in patients with the CC gene (P<0.05). Conclusions: Polymorphisms of GSTP1 rs1695 and ABCC2 rs717620 can be used to predict the outcomes of Uygur patients with advanced NSCLC who have received platinum-based chemotherapy. Additionally, this information could be used to guide the individualized treatment of Uygur patients with advanced NSCLC.\n"}]}, "text": "Background: Gene polymorphisms are associated with sensitivity to platinum drugs.
