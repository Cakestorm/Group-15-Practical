{"title": "Article 1329", "body": "Background: Gene polymorphisms are associated with sensitivity to platinum drugs. This study aimed to investigate the polymorphisms of GSTP1 rs1695 locus and ABCC2 rs717620 locus, and the sensitivity of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to platinum drugs in a Xinjiang Uygur population. Material/Methods: The gene polymorphisms of GSTP1 rs1695 and ABCC2 rs717620 of Uygur NSCLC patients were assessed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). The relationship between the prognosis of advanced NSCLC Uygur patients and the gene polymorphisms of GSTP1 rs1695 and ABCC2 rs717620 was analyzed using progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) as the major outcome indicators. Results: The median PFS of patients with advanced NSCLC was 6.9 months and the OS of Uygur patients with advanced NSCLC was 10.8 months. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicated that survival time of patients with GSTP1 AG + GG was significantly longer than in patients with AA gene (P<0.05), and survival time of patients with ABCC2 CT + TT was significantly longer than in patients with the CC gene (P<0.05). Conclusions: Polymorphisms of GSTP1 rs1695 and ABCC2 rs717620 can be used to predict the outcomes of Uygur patients with advanced NSCLC who have received platinum-based chemotherapy. Additionally, this information could be used to guide the individualized treatment of Uygur patients with advanced NSCLC.\n", "text": "Background: Gene polymorphisms are associated with sensitivity to platinum drugs.
