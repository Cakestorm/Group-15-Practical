{"title": "Article 1186", "body": {"ops": [{"insert": "Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer among women worldwide. Tumor immunology suggests relationships between the immune system, chronic inflammation, and cancer. The immune system may either prevent or promote carcinogenesis. Here, we evaluated molecular signaling pathways common in inflammation and cancer and detected the microRNAs which play pivotal roles in mediating these pathways. Using bioinformatics assays, signaling pathways common in inflammation and cancer, and microRNAs mediating these pathways were identified. MiR-590 was selected and cloned into the pLenti-III-eGFP vector and transfected into the breast cancer cell lines. The expression level of microRNA and the candidate genes was evaluated by real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and the apoptosis level in transfected cells was measured by Annexin V-7AAD assay. The cell migration was tested by real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for MMP2/MMP9. The expression levels of miR-590 and the selected genes (i.e. JAK2, PI3K, MAPK1, and CREB) were measured 72 h after transfection. While miR-590 showed an over-expression, the genes were significantly down-regulated. A significant increase was observed in apoptosis level in both cell lines and MMP2/MMP9 was significantly decreased in MDA-MB-231 cells. MiR-590 was selected as a microRNA which triggers and down-regulates critical genes of signaling pathways similar in cancer and inflammation. Following the miR-590 treatment, JAK2, PI3K, MAPK1, and CREB were down-regulated and the apoptosis level was increased in breast cancer cell lines. Apparently, some microRNAs can be good candidates for novel treatments of cancer. Although miR-590 showed good results in this study, further studies are required to investigate the role of miR-590 in breast cancer therapy.\n"}]}, "text": "Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer among women worldwide.
