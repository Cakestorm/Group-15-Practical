Healthy older participants and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients show better memory for faces with positive expressions.

Another explanation might be that older participants use compensatory strategies, often considering happy faces as previously seen. The question about the existence of this effect in tasks not permitting such compensatory strategies is still open. Thus, we compared the performance of healthy participants and AD patients for positive, neutral, and negative faces in such tasks. Healthy older participants and AD patients showed a positivity effect in memory, but there was no difference between emotional and neutral faces in young participants. Our results suggest that the positivity effect in memory is not entirely due to the sense of familiarity for smiling faces.\n"}]}, "text": "Young individuals better memorize initially seen faces with emotional rather than neutral expressions.
