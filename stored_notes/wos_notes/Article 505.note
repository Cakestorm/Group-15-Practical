Severely pre-eclamptic pregnant women expressed less mature miR-155 compared to healthy pregnant women. In addition, angiotensin H type 1 receptor expression decreased substantially in healthy cells and miR-155-transfected cells compared to miR-155-mutant-transfected cells and cells from pre-eclamptic patients. Mature miR-155 reduced angiotensin II-induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 activation. In conclusion, endogenous mature miR-155 expression may be an important contributor to the pathogenesis of severe pre-eclampsia.\n"}]}, "text": "Angiotensin II is critical in pre-eclampsia pathogenesis.
