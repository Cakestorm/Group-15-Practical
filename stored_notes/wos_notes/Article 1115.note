{"title": "Article 1115", "body": "Background: Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are multipotent cells with a high constitutive level of autophagy and low expression of CD99. Under certain conditions, MSCs may develop tumorigenic properties. However, these transformation-induced conditions are largely unknown. Recently, we have identified an association between Hsp70, a main participant in cellular stress response and tumorigenesis, and CD99. Preliminary observations had revealed upregulation of both proteins in stressed long-term cultured MSCs. And so we hypothesized that CD99 is implicated in stress-induced mechanisms of cellular transformation in MSCs. Hence, we investigated the effects of prolonged stress on MSCs and the role of CD99 and autophagy in their survival. Methods: Human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) overexpressing immortalized MSCs and primary bone marrow stromal cells were used to investigate the influence of long-term serum deprivation and hypoxia on growth and differentiation of MSCs. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were evaluated using flow cytometry, differentiation capabilities of MSCs were assessed by immunohistochemical staining followed by microscopic examination. CD99, Hsp70 expression were analyzed using flow cytometry, western blotting, and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Autophagy was explored with specific inhibitors using cell morphology examination and western blotting. Results: Chronic stress factors are able to change the morphology of MSCs and to inhibit spontaneous differentiation into adipocyte lineage. Furthermore, CD99 elevation and downregulation of p53 and p21 accompanied defective autophagy, which is usually associated with tumor formation. We found that inhibition of autophagy by chloroquine promoted cell detachment and modulated CD99 expression level whereas incorporation of CD99 recombinant protein into the cells suppressed autophagy. Conclusions: Obtained results provide a model for chronic stress-induced transformation of MSCs via CD99 and may therefore be highly relevant to mesenchymal tumorigenesis.\n", "text": "Background: Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are multipotent cells with a high constitutive level of autophagy and low expression of CD99.
