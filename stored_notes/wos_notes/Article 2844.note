{"title": "Article 2844", "body": {"ops": [{"insert": "The use of hybrid short fibers in a suitable combination as reinforcement for cement based materials has attracted widespread attention because of their benefits compared to mono fiber reinforcement in recent years. This paper provides a review of recent developments on the area of the cement-based composites reinforced by hybrid short fibers. The aim of paper is to represent the effects of hybridization by elaborating upon the chemical, physical and mechanical properties of fibers on the performance of fiber reinforced concretes (FRC). This provides a summary of the existing knowledge about the successful use of different hybrid forms such as combination of steel, polymer and natural fibers in cementitious composites. Different types of hybrid system depending on fiber type are classified and reviewed. Furthermore, the physical and mechanical properties of resultant composites are also presented. Generally, inclusion of fibers in concrete as hybrid forms, improves many of its engineering properties such as toughness, ductility, energy absorption capacity and durability performance in comparison with mono fiber reinforcement.
