{"body": "Background: Cell necrosis, oxidative damage, and fibrogenesis are involved in cirrhosis development, a condition in which insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels are diminished. This study evaluates whether the exogenous administration of low doses of IGF-1 can induce hepatoprotection in acute carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced liver damage compared to healthy controls (Wt Igf(+/+)). Additionally, the impact of IGF-1 deficiency on a damaged liver was investigated in mice with a partial deficit of this hormone (Hz Igf1(+/-)). Methods: Three groups of 25 +/- 5-week-old healthy male mice (Wt Igf(+/+)) were included in the protocol: untreated controls (Wt). Controls that received CCl4 (Wt + CCl4) and Wt + CCl4 were treated subcutaneously with IGF-1 (2 mu g/100 g body weight/day) for 10 days (Wt + CCl4 + IGF1). In parallel, three IGF-1-deficient mice (Hz Igf1(+/-)) groups were studied: untreated Hz, Hz + CCl4, and Hz + CCl4 + IGF-1. Microarray and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analyses, serum aminotransferases levels, liver histology, and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were assessed at the end of the treatment in all groups. All data represent mean +/- SEM. Results: An altered gene coding expression pattern for proteins of the extracellular matrix, fibrosis, and cellular protection were found, as compared to healthy controls, in which IGF-1 therapy normalized in the series including healthy mice. Liver histology showed that Wt + CCl4 + IGF1 mice had less oxidative damage, fibrosis, lymphocytic infiltrate, and cellular changes when compared to the Wt + CCl4. Moreover, there was a correlation between MDA levels and the histological damage score (Pearson's r = 0.858). In the IGF-1-deficient mice series, similar findings were identified, denoting a much more vulnerable hepatic parenchyma. Conclusions: IGF1 treatment improved the biochemistry, histology, and genetic expression of pro-regenerative and cytoprotective factors in both series (healthy and IGF-1-deficient mice) with acute liver damage, suggesting that low doses of IGF-1, in acute liver damage, could be a feasible therapeutic option.\n", "embeddings": ["1.6370775", "0.16672203", "-0.5325293", "-0.75861394", "-0.10483151", "-1.2433896", "0.4671241", "0.19230543", "-2.4841597", "1.6118643", "-1.046431", "0.3985826", "0.7320824", "1.066026", "-2.685498", "-0.5112912", "-0.25940204", "-0.6249805", "1.287684", "-4.527547", "-0.318623", "0.3712743", "-1.6619732", "0.7650185", "-0.45970854", "-0.05305012", "0.34379894", "0.67973495", "-1.5879053", "0.47477406", "0.3563191", "0.6399532", "-1.2894641", "0.5824054", "0.6015763", "0.7943218", "0.004890602", "0.041985255", "-0.46997803", "-0.8885982", "-1.1533403", "0.18148701", "-0.65497833", "1.1728352", "0.71921915", "0.29893652", "1.4886835", "0.035766706", "0.7567512", "-1.116029", "0.20007792", "-1.5786245", "-2.1073802", "0.5671138", "0.71083134", "0.05331227", "1.181354", "0.13282426", "-1.5316361", "-0.10657348", "-0.41907218", "0.61403084", "0.6794973", "0.36522406", "-0.9993562", "-0.6394971", "0.9284829", "2.537209", "-0.55386657", "0.051075656", "1.7113596", "2.749321", "-2.1122935", "1.9354582", "-0.76502883", "0.6634548", "0.05222735", "-0.7540227", "-1.3656034", "2.4796436", "0.4884051", "-0.5327661", "-1.8882331", "1.4957554", "-1.1352072", "-2.1527073", "0.18152897", "-0.11007177", "-0.15222001", "-0.16487145", "-0.18657061", "0.87689185", "-0.5004425", "1.7404567", "1.2453454", "-0.31995916", "-1.8588829", "0.0018968919", "0.31271702", "0.54376405", "0.0903268", "0.40491018", "1.7127489", "-0.72266567", "-0.8845223", "1.3088593", "0.25331184", "1.4616729", "0.19110021", "-1.0229146", "0.8921909", "0.13744135", "-0.033071596", "-0.7112549", "0.6835792", "-1.0771298", "-0.160317", "-2.0243359", "-0.53874224", "0.15584463", "0.28577963", "-0.33771992", "0.92279524", "-1.8181704", "0.4400558", "-0.055770732", "-0.15247057", "-1.6948932", "-0.901629", "-1.9781659", "0.34468827", "1.0979087", "-1.3523581", "0.43379813", "0.4550437", "1.3322444", "-1.0611651", "0.8962228", "-0.34649137", "2.071995", "0.5122798", "-0.43036923", "0.018899608", "-2.8328993", "-0.29743913", "-1.5562967", "1.737627", "0.6219245", "-0.28861833", "-0.4555482", "0.9473323", "-0.13320972", "-0.33430094", "0.3137146", "-0.9029326", "0.4180369", "1.0297973", "0.07924257", "-1.4643291", "-0.54796547", "0.7835702", "-0.16891015", "1.4261229", "0.32332936", "-1.2420832", "1.0798433", "-0.4101642", "-0.9252972", "-0.9251129", "-1.4423077", "0.10625862", "0.27771628", "0.45275673", "-0.6388278", "-0.020459967", "-0.765746", "0.8854391", "1.4247739", "-0.075432524", "-0.39560464", "0.52794445", "-1.4725492", "-0.9978954", "-0.40060797", "0.35802445", "-0.0700806", "0.18862386", "1.885509", "-0.08054288", "-1.5879413", "-0.5017169", "0.5689603", "-0.34601858", "-2.3726223", "1.6681734", "-0.018003745", "-0.65478384", "-0.15010354", "-0.32585868", "-2.6186085"]}
