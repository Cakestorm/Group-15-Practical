{"title": "Article 923", "body": "Selective inhibitors of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) are an emerging class of pharmaceuticals due to the involvement of HDAC6 in different pathways related to neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, and immunology. Herein, the synthesis of ten new benzohydroxamic acids, constructed by employing the tetrahydrobenzothiazepine core as a privileged pharmacophoric unit, is described. This is the first report on the synthesis and isolation of octahydrodibenzothiazepines and octahydro-6H-benzocycloheptathiazepines, which were then used to develop a new class of HDAC6 inhibitors. Evaluations of their HDAC-inhibiting activity resulted in the identification of cis-N-(4-hydroxycarbamoyl-benzyl)-1,2,3,4,4a, 5,11,11a-octahydrodibenzo[b, e] [1,4]thiazepine-10,10-dioxide and cis-N-(4-hydroxycarbamoyl-benzyl)-7-trifluoromethyl-1,2,3,4,4a, 5,11,11a-octahydrodibenzo[b,e][1,4]thiazepine-10,10-dioxide as highly potent and selective HDAC6 inhibitors with activity in the low nanomolar range, which also show excellent selectivity on the enzymatic and cellular levels. Furthermore, four promising inhibitors were subjected to an Ames fluctuation assay, which revealed no mutagenic effects associated with these structures.\n", "text": "Selective inhibitors of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) are an emerging class of pharmaceuticals due to the involvement of HDAC6 in different pathways related to neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, and immunology.
