{"body": "Background: A 12-month, open-label extension study assessed the long-term safety and tolerability of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX) in adults with binge eating disorder (BED). Methods: Adults (aged 18-55 y) with BED who completed 1 of 3 antecedent studies were enrolled in a 52-week, open-label extension study (dose optimization, 4 weeks [initial titration dose, 30-mg LDX; target doses, 50-or 70-mg LDX]; dose maintenance, 48 weeks). Safety evaluations included the occurrence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), vital sign and weight assessments, and Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale responses. Results: Of the 604 enrolled participants, 599 (521 women and 78 men) comprised the safety analysis set, and 369 completed the study. Mean (SD) LDX exposure was 284.3 (118.84) days; cumulative LDX exposure duration was 12 months or longer in 344 participants (57.4%). A total of 506 participants (84.5%) reported TEAEs (TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation, 54 [9.0%]; severe TEAEs, 42 [7.0%]; serious TEAEs, 17 [2.8%]). Treatment-emergent adverse events reported in greater than or equal to 10% of participants were dry mouth (27.2%), headache (13.2%), insomnia (12.4%), and upper respiratory tract infection (11.4%). Mean (SD) changes from antecedent study baseline in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse, and weight at week 52/early termination (n = 597) were 2.19 (11.043) and 1.77 (7.848) mm Hg, 6.58 (10.572) beats per minute, and -7.04 (7.534) kg, respectively. On the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale, there were 2 positive responses for any active suicidal ideations; there were no positive responses for suicidal behavior or completed suicides. Conclusions: In this 12-month, open-label, extension study, the long-term safety and tolerability of LDX in adults with BED were generally consistent with its established profile for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.\n", "embeddings": ["-0.40705982", "-2.0006511", "0.99424994", "0.88273823", "0.5404066", "0.3825732", "0.15409434", "2.3680081", "-0.90503585", "1.068852", "-0.062216993", "-0.027217008", "-0.09917451", "-0.26625606", "-0.20773679", "-1.6883013", "0.6715972", "0.030795824", "0.10217943", "-2.5200756", "-0.9771669", "0.9506799", "0.31929582", "-0.55347323", "1.8369089", "0.25368664", "-0.0002570031", "-1.6484069", "-0.17520621", "-0.3596511", "1.1579028", "0.5103637", "-1.21335", "0.17256396", "-1.0552424", "-0.07004124", "0.30703005", "-0.37360656", "1.1593362", "0.50014955", "1.0243386", "0.03151102", "2.1858313", "0.09136806", "-0.779386", "-0.38974455", "-0.9789381", "0.9766274", "-1.6543133", "-0.6421138", "2.6185951", "0.06265255", "-1.2078326", "0.14433359", "-0.122651264", "2.1471055", "-0.34286708", "2.844034", "-0.38282147", "0.16046976", "-0.26883125", "1.0414501", "0.8963136", "1.0868415", "-0.86057556", "-0.05525783", "-0.45093977", "1.2614304", "-0.7552546", "0.7840175", "0.780658", "2.2501056", "-0.9579089", "1.1027225", "-0.12886322", "3.826336", "-0.106676266", "-1.353339", "-1.0765903", "1.276808", "-1.1752911", "1.3444836", "-0.4951259", "1.6638677", "-0.45865285", "-1.1193767", "-0.63433266", "-0.24146621", "-0.30115354", "-0.8731079", "0.24481148", "-0.40659797", "0.054669507", "0.57424927", "1.4410089", "-0.27997857", "0.9160681", "1.325592", "0.5828728", "0.5193391", "-0.07225734", "0.4859248", "0.71582305", "-0.45444408", "-1.2251327", "-2.5271826", "0.04841578", "1.223128", "-0.61728287", "-0.72077006", "-1.105651", "-0.3461719", "-0.2949484", "0.39233768", "-0.26175544", "-0.4902395", "0.21786955", "-1.5608937", "-0.40617603", "-1.8972714", "1.1323416", "-0.08432116", "-0.50486505", "-1.6906848", "-0.026880544", "0.71411914", "-0.43446237", "0.34349176", "0.9752518", "0.009251993", "1.6038753", "-1.9910587", "-1.4024957", "-2.4514759", "1.2594206", "0.63752586", "-0.39104113", "-0.1319368", "-1.4008162", "-1.3573076", "-0.37328437", "-0.2769176", "-0.7083795", "-0.17339426", "0.5516263", "-0.028641578", "-0.04123305", "0.7917726", "-1.072791", "1.396317", "-0.4712292", "-0.1516995", "-1.4755692", "1.3336623", "-1.6840171", "0.14119522", "-0.36163518", "-1.2482449", "1.1456885", "-0.7544357", "-0.01584635", "1.3348279", "0.21302263", "0.44189763", "0.055012897", "-0.3502196", "-0.122796595", "-1.1004099", "0.64732486", "-0.0061093126", "-1.1184604", "0.04263578", "0.26187804", "-0.90402263", "0.82798976", "0.2669756", "-0.64526844", "1.4524442", "-0.3039495", "-0.61138284", "-0.052955218", "0.48055217", "0.17627335", "0.2250606", "-0.28473115", "-1.8693888", "-0.6897343", "1.0261065", "-0.16591592", "1.2394344", "0.09294486", "-0.3509215", "-0.35903233", "-0.89943224", "-0.22225061", "0.6066181", "0.16996874", "0.41354054", "1.2910826", "-0.66566336"]}
