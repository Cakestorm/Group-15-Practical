{"title": "Article 2327", "body": "Loudspeakers line arrays are very common reproduction sound systems used in real environments (e.g., theaters, stadiums, cinemas, and conference halls) for synthesizing the directivity characteristics of a linear source. The sound field emitted by a vertical line array can be pointed in a particular direction by using digital signal processing techniques and avoiding any mechanical movements. The approach proposed in this paper to obtain the desired directivity behavior takes advantage of the reproduction of a virtual source with frequency-independent directivity characteristics using wave field synthesis theory and introducing a computational complexity reduction. A full investigation on the performance of the technique has been carried out making comparisons with other approaches proposed in the literature thus providing an overview of the results achievable with digital steering of line arrays.
