At the optimum reaction conditions, the conversion could reach above 46% with >99% enantiomeric excess of the product, (R)-1-phenylethyl acetate, when the substrate concentration was below 1.4 M. The enzyme displayed an excellent enantioselectivity with an E-value of >200 and a strong tolerance for high substrate concentration of up to 1.8 M.
