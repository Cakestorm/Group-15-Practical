{"title": "Article 675", "body": "A mycelium-bound lipase from Aspergillus oryzae (AOL) exhibited excellent enantioselectivity for kinetic resolution of (RS)-1-phenylethanol ((RS)-1-PE) in organic solvent. The various reaction parameters affecting the conversion and enantioselectivity were studied, including type of acyl donor, solvent, molar ratio, temperature, enzyme amount, and substrate concentration. The optimum reaction conditions were found to be transesterification with vinyl acetate at 30 degrees C in methyl tert-butyl ether with a vinyl acetate: (RS)-1-PE molar ratio of 1: 1 and an enzyme concentration of 60 g/L. At the optimum reaction conditions, the conversion could reach above 46% with >99% enantiomeric excess of the product, (R)-1-phenylethyl acetate, when the substrate concentration was below 1.4 M. The enzyme displayed an excellent enantioselectivity with an E-value of >200 and a strong tolerance for high substrate concentration of up to 1.8 M. Those results indicated that AOL was a promising biocatalyst in the kinetic resolution of (RS)-1-PE.
