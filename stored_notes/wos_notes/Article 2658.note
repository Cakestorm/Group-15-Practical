{"title": "Article 2658", "body": "Background: Improving islet graft revascularization has become a crucial task for prolonging islet graft survival. Endothelial cells (ECs) are the basis of new microvessels in an isolated islet, and EC coating has been demonstrated to improve the vascularization and survival of an islet. However, the traditional method of EC coating of islets has low efficiency in vitro. This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of a polyglycolic acid (PGA) scaffold on the efficiency of islet coating by ECs and the angiogenesis in the coated islet graft. Methods: A PGA fibrous scaffold was used for EC coating of islet culture and was evaluated for its efficiency of EC coating on islets and islet graft angiogenesis. Results: In in vitro experiments, we found that apoptosis index of ECs-coating islet in PGA group (27% +/- 8%) was significantly lower than that in control group (83% +/- 20%, P < 0.05) after 7 days culture. Stimulation index was significantly greater in the PGA group than in the control group at day 7 after ECs-coating (2.07 +/- 0.31 vs. 1.80 +/- 0.23, P < 0.05). vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) level in the PGA group was significantly higher than the coating in the control group after 7 days culture (52.10 +/- 13.50 ng/ml vs. 16.30 +/- 8.10 ng/ml, P < 0.05). Because of a tight, circumvallated, adhesive and three-dimensional growth microenvironment, islet cultured in a PGA scaffold had higher coating efficiency showing stronger staining intensity of enzyme than those in the control group after 14 days of culture following ECs-coating. For in vivo study, PGA scaffold significantly prolonged the average survival time of EC-coated islet graft after transplantation compared with control group (15.30 +/- 5.60 days vs. 8.30 +/- 2.45 days, P < 0.05). The angiogenesis and area of survived grafts were more in the PGA group compared with the control group by measuring the mean microvessel density (8.60 +/- 1.21/mm(2) vs. 5.20 +/- 0.87/mm(2), P < 0.05). In addition, expression of VEGF and tyrosin-protein kinase receptor (Tie-2) gene increased in PGA scaffold group than that in control group by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that the efficiency of EC coating of islets was successfully increased by culturing ECs on a PGA scaffold. This method enhances the function, survival, and vascularization of isolated islets in vitro and in vivo.\n", "text": "Background: Improving islet graft revascularization has become a crucial task for prolonging islet graft survival.
