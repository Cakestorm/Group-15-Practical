{"title": "Article 942", "body": "This paper presents a novel interleaved high-conversion-ratio bidirectional dc-dc converter based on switched capacitors and coupled inductors. Series-connected switched capacitor and inductor cells were used to increase the voltage conversion ratio, reduce voltage stresses on power switches, realize soft-charging/discharging of switched capacitors, and achieve autocurrent-sharing in parallel inductors. The interleaved structure combined with switched capacitors was adopted to reduce current ripple at the side having lower voltage, thus enabling applications that require high power levels. In this paper, we first review the status of high-voltage-ratio bidirectional dc-dc converters. Then, the evolution of the proposed extensible topologies and the steady-state operating principle under the inductor current continuous conduction mode is presented. Finally, the performance and features such as voltage gain, voltage and current stress, and the autocurrent-sharing mechanism that are realized by switched capacitors are verified; the optimal design of coupled-inductors, switched-capacitors, and the chip size of switches are given. A specific design of the driving circuit that facilitates actual applications is described. A 1-kW prototype converter, employing a hybrid configuration of SiC and Si MOSFETs, was constructed to verify the theoretical analysis, and achieved an optimal compromise between conversion efficiency and low cost.\n", "text": "This paper presents a novel interleaved high-conversion-ratio bidirectional dc-dc converter based on switched capacitors and coupled inductors.
