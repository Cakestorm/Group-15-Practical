{"body": "Breast carcinogenesis is a multistep process, involving both genetic and epigenetic modification process of genes, involved in diverse pathways ranging from DNA repair to metabolic processes. This study was undertaken to assess the role of promoter methylation of GSTP1 gene, a member of glutathione-S-transferase family of enzymes, in relation to its expression, polymorphism, and clinicopathological parameters. Tissue samples were taken from breast cancer patients and paired with their normal adjacent tissues. A total of 51 subjects were studied, in which the frequency of promoter methylation in cancerous tissue was 37.25% as against 11% in the normal tissues (p = 0.001). The hypermethylated status of the gene was significantly associated with the loss of the protein expression (r = -0.449, p = 0.001, odds ratio = 7.42, 95% confidence interval = 2.05-26.92). Furthermore, when compared with the clinical parameters, the significant association was found between the promoter hypermethylation and lymph node metastasis (p = 0.001), tumor stage (p = 0.039), tumor grade (p = 0.028), estrogen receptor status (p = 0.018), and progesterone receptor status (p = 0.046). Our study is the first of its kind in Kashmiri population, which indicates that GSTP1 shows aberrant methylation pattern in the breast cancer with the consequent loss in the protein expression. Furthermore, it also shows that the gene polymorphism (Ile105Val) at codon 105 is not related to the promoter methylation and two are the independent events in breast cancer development.\n", "embeddings": ["-0.05613831", "-0.6044983", "0.12845077", "-0.25393626", "0.44020975", "1.1910753", "0.61409175", "0.45792323", "-1.5136496", "1.1418463", "0.30167684", "0.1771128", "-0.14085121", "0.77809525", "-0.40182462", "-0.0045808884", "0.66907054", "-0.050182436", "-0.4813309", "-1.6220818", "0.9514725", "-0.887451", "0.11617626", "0.2628179", "-0.37098396", "-0.53026885", "0.26457047", "0.7501824", "-0.8582225", "1.3737081", "0.97059685", "-0.5456268", "-0.32184714", "-1.0415685", "1.2817535", "-0.28727335", "0.6791196", "-0.66100645", "0.28424498", "-0.39026526", "0.52589655", "0.80667907", "-1.8485782", "-0.31350166", "-0.48553395", "-0.86149925", "-0.115885876", "0.15706608", "-1.4064014", "-0.71323216", "-0.23577996", "-1.3891517", "-0.73062664", "-0.3340266", "0.30759066", "1.1608006", "0.9870519", "0.2687155", "-0.27691063", "0.011905295", "0.24631639", "1.3606495", "0.40170306", "0.17148423", "-0.85345715", "1.8652011", "0.57870233", "1.1683089", "0.262822", "0.647046", "-0.37415323", "1.485156", "0.34006673", "0.67327857", "0.38898215", "0.47500184", "0.5874184", "0.4784255", "-1.4524997", "-1.6896201", "1.0622771", "-1.2374179", "-0.021503406", "0.5400957", "-0.6847883", "0.08683213", "0.1956225", "0.80445737", "-0.7685245", "0.06640769", "0.11515085", "0.85361326", "-0.20504157", "0.32680997", "-0.04689328", "-0.69629556", "-0.26389146", "0.7371716", "0.09827985", "-1.9041355", "1.2343233", "0.3009022", "1.0314001", "-0.21902701", "0.5461071", "-0.6100863", "-0.7740276", "1.4888191", "0.301464", "1.1590766", "-1.3519268", "-0.29828948", "1.2677636", "0.235969", "-1.6017376", "-1.0405303", "-0.26951474", "0.15415968", "-0.96098316", "-0.328478", "0.58976036", "-0.47334644", "0.0011986528", "-0.55840635", "-1.1282525", "-0.73578346", "-1.1956812", "-1.2944609", "0.035615247", "0.9431936", "1.4604009", "0.33395872", "-0.9782996", "-0.04391556", "-0.81152797", "0.7289848", "-0.37602198", "-0.685814", "-0.070854254", "0.46873155", "0.29323292", "-0.51954913", "-0.110059865", "-1.0842878", "-0.034745615", "-0.19932343", "1.6174104", "0.17681645", "-1.3119079", "1.4404547", "-0.030955696", "-0.47812575", "-0.99025", "1.3179631", "-1.1457618", "1.2635878", "-0.07773433", "1.0763006", "-0.11259252", "-0.017912239", "0.71497655", "-0.084049776", "1.4860232", "-0.07100035", "-0.5570422", "0.4721815", "1.3607451", "-0.24655457", "0.42165232", "0.74252117", "-1.2424775", "0.1714389", "1.4337087", "-0.20913178", "1.9838212", "-1.5005592", "-0.8358329", "0.24949278", "-0.03211111", "0.4947768", "-0.46049875", "-0.52743083", "0.85357827", "-1.5007279", "-0.18826832", "-0.20835137", "1.9231023", "0.039295357", "1.0858512", "-1.056608", "1.4999596", "-0.37915945", "1.1689634", "-0.12682751", "1.1177307", "-0.4377459", "0.74763626", "-1.1397837", "-0.9110983", "0.37366754"]}
