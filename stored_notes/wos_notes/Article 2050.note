{"title": "Article 2050", "body": "The diversity and dynamics of the dominant bacterial communities arising during the pickling process of bamboo shoots (Dendrocalamus latiflorus) were investigated by nested polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis combined with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results showed only several kinds of halophilic bacteria during early sampling time (0-3days). After pickling for 7days, Lactococcus lactis significantly increased (P<0.05, quantities were 6.39x10(5) copiesL(-1)) and became the first dominant bacterium. After pickling for 14days, Weissella sp. bands appeared and quickly became dominant on the 21st day (4.07x10(6) copiesL(-1)). As maturation progressed, Lc.lactis decreased in intensity whereas Weissella sp. increased in intensity. Finally, the quantities of Weissella sp. (2.50x10(7) copiesL(-1)) became higher than those of Lc.lactis (1.43x10(7) copiesL(-1)) after pickling for 56days. The pickling process was initiated by Lc.lactis, followed by Lc.lactis and Weissella sp., and was finally succeeded by Weissella sp.\n", "text": "The diversity and dynamics of the dominant bacterial communities arising during the pickling process of bamboo shoots (Dendrocalamus latiflorus) were investigated by nested polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis combined with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.
