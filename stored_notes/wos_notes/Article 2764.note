{"title": "Article 2764", "body": "An effective approach in early intervention for children and families, including child maltreatment prevention, is home-based services. Although several evidence-based programs exist, they are often grouped or delivered together, despite having different foci and approaches. This article describes the development and pilot phases of a trial evaluating the systematic braiding of 2 evidence-based home-based models, SafeCare and Parents as Teachers. We describe the methodology for braiding model implementation and curriculum, specifically focusing on how structured qualitative feedback from pilot families and providers was used to create the braided curriculum and implementation. Systematic braiding of 2 models at the implementation and curriculum levels is a mechanism that has the potential to meet the more comprehensive needs of families at risk for maltreatment.\n", "text": "An effective approach in early intervention for children and families, including child maltreatment prevention, is home-based services.
