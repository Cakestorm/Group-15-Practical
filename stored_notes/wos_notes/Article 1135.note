{"title": "Article 1135", "body": "This paper presents a novel predictive digital control method for boundary conduction mode PFC converters without the need for detecting the inductor current. In the proposed method, the inductor current is predicted by analytical equations instead of being detected by a sensing-resistor. The predicted zero-crossing point of the inductor current is determined by the values of the input voltage, output voltage and predicted inductor current. Importantly, the prediction of zero-crossing point is achieved in just a single switching cycle. Therefore, the errors in predictive calculation caused by parameter variations can be compensated. The prediction of the zero-crossing point with the proposed method has been shown to have good accuracy. The proposed method also shows high stability towards variations in both the inductance and output power. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed predictive digital control method for PFC converters.\n", "text": "This paper presents a novel predictive digital control method for boundary conduction mode PFC converters without the need for detecting the inductor current.
