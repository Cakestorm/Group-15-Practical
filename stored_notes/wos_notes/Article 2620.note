Some microRNAs might play a key role during embryo implantation in the mouse, but the let-7a expression profiles in the rat uterus during peri-implantation are unknown.

The effect of steroid hormones on let-7a expression was also detected by Northern blotting and in situ hybridization.

Let-7a was specifically localized in glandular and luminal epithelia and decidua. The expression of let-7a was not significantly different in the pseudopregnant uterus and increased significantly in the uteri of rats subjected to artificial decidualization and activation of delayed implantation. Treatment with estradiol-17 beta or progesterone significantly increased let-7a expression. Thus, let-7a expression was significantly induced by the process of embryo invasion, and this increased expression level was mainly induced by active blastocysts and decidualization during the window of implantation, implying that let-7a may participate in endometrial decidualization.
