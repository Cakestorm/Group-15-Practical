{"title": "Article 1002", "body": "The fast growth of the human population forces us to produce more food, but higher crop production also leads to the fast spread of diseases. Plant pathology deploys a wide range of methods that do not provide an adequate solution to all disease losses. In the case of viroids, therapeutic means of control are not available; therefore control strategies are more focused on the development of reliable detection methods to quickly exclude the infected plant material. Although viroids are the smallest and simplest plant pathogens, their identification and detection is not straightforward. Each viroid-host combination is specific, and for reliable identification, all steps from sampling to final detection must be performed accurately. In this review, several methods for viroid detection in various host plants are discussed, including their advantages and disadvantages. Even though relatively new molecular methods enable fast and sensitive detection of viroids, a combination of different methods gives the most reliable identification. Techniques based on nucleic acids may be the future for viroid detection but they still cannot replace biological indexing, which is usually essential in epidemiological and aetiological studies.\n", "text": "The fast growth of the human population forces us to produce more food, but higher crop production also leads to the fast spread of diseases.
