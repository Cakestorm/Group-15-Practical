{"title": "Article 869", "body": "High metabolic activity and low levels of antioxidant enzymes make neurons particularly prone to damage by reactive oxygen species. Thus, repair of oxidative DNA damage is essential for normal brain function. Base excision repair is the major pathway for repair of oxidative DNA damage, and is initiated by DNA glycosylases recognizing and removing the damaged base. In mammalian cells at least five different DNA glycosylases with overlapping substrate specificity, NEIL1, NEIL2, NEIL3, OGG1 and NTH1, remove oxidative DNA base lesions. Here we report mRNA expression and distribution of these five DNA glycosylases in human and rodent brains using in situ hybridization and Northern blotting supported by glycosylase activity assays. NEIL1, NEIL2, OGG1 and NTH1 showed widespread expression at all ages. in situ hybridization studies in mouse brain showed that expression of mNeil1 increased with age. In newborn mouse brain, mNeil3 revealed a discrete expression pattern in brain regions known to harbour stem cell populations, i.e., the subventricular zone, the rostral migratory stream, and the hilar region of the hippocampal formation. Expression of mNeil3 decreased with age, and in old mice brains could be detected only in layer V of neocortex. MNth1 was constitutively expressed during lifespan. in Northern blots, mOgg1 expression showed a transient decrease followed by an increase after 8 weeks of age. Assays for faPy DNA glycosylase activity revealed increased activity level with age in all brain regions analyzed.\n", "text": "High metabolic activity and low levels of antioxidant enzymes make neurons particularly prone to damage by reactive oxygen species.
