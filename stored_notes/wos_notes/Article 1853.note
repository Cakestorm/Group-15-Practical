Digital Image-Based Colorimetric Analysis was also used for determination of the concentrations of the metal ions as a fast and low-cost colorimetric detections for quantitative chemical analysis. At the optimum conditions, the analytical characteristics of the two methods (e.g., limit of detection and linear range) were evaluated. Linearity was obeyed.in the range of 0.5-10 ng m1(-1) of Au(III) with a linear correlation coefficient of 0.999. The new sensor displayed high sensitivity for very low concentrations of the detectable metals analytes up to 10(-10) mol L-1 in solution. Results showed evidence that Thiomichler's Ketone (TMK) sensor will attract worldwide attention as a promising technological means of recovering and recycling silver, gold and palladium.
