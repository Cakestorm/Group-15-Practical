Tissue samples from seropositive pigs and from mice of the bioassay were submitted to histopathology, immunohistochemistry, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing; 14.1% of pig tissue samples and 27.7% of bioassayed mouse samples were positive for T. gondii DNA, but all pig and mouse tissues were negative in histopathology analysis and immunochemistry. By using a risk assessment questionnaire, there was significant difference (p< 0.001) in seroprevalence of 21.2% (reproducer) and 3.1% (finishing pig).

Preventive measures must be implemented by health services to avoid toxoplasmosis human cases due to ingestion of pig meat.\n"}]}, "text": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the occurrence of Toxoplasma gondii in backyard pigs destined for human consumption in Pernambuco state, Brazil.
