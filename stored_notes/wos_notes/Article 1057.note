{"body": "Background: Bipolar disorder is a common chronic illness characterized by high levels of morbidity and all-cause mortality. Lithium is one of the gold standard mood stabilizer treatments, but the identification of good, partial and non-responders in clinical settings is inconsistent. Methods: We used an established rating scale (the Alda scale) to classify the degree of lithium response (good response, partial response, non-response) in a large, multicentre clinically representative sample of well-characterized cases of bipolar disorders I and II. Next, we examined previously reported clinical predictors of response to determine which factors significantly differentiated between the three response groups. Results: Of 754 cases, 300 received lithium, for at least 6months, as a treatment for bipolar disorder (40%). Of these cases, 17% were classified as good response, 52% as partial response and 31% as non-response. Lifetime history of mixed episodes (p=0.017) and alcohol use disorders (p=0.015) both occurred in >20% of partial response and non-response groups but <10% of good response cases. Family history of bipolar disorder I was of borderline statistical significance, being more frequent in the good response group (38%) compared with the non-response group (18%). There was a trend (p=0.06) for bipolar disorder II to be associated with non-response. Conclusions: Only three factors previously identified as predictors of lithium response significantly differentiated the response groups identified in our sample. Interestingly, these factors have all been found to co-occur more often than expected by chance, and it can be hypothesized that they may represent a shared underlying factor or dimension. Further prospective studies of predictors and the performance of the Alda scale are recommended.\n", "embeddings": ["0.9959929", "0.15740398", "0.94347817", "1.1971424", "0.09654102", "0.054370165", "-0.2803565", "0.41478527", "-1.5576277", "-0.97328126", "-0.82051337", "0.86734945", "1.245448", "0.2444633", "-1.0043864", "0.84377646", "-0.42043826", "-0.13781959", "-0.21085382", "-2.112736", "-1.0997437", "-0.25338215", "-0.18613526", "0.33756277", "0.67551565", "-0.23862413", "-0.50313884", "-0.3411365", "0.046592917", "0.3287221", "0.6498077", "2.382316", "0.35826802", "1.1271504", "1.2128212", "0.49775696", "-0.95160645", "-1.4505758", "-0.97166574", "1.0935154", "-1.4595636", "-0.046776664", "0.47556123", "0.73477226", "2.1945257", "-0.3409396", "-2.0294585", "-0.8087164", "-0.6224229", "0.18702275", "-0.2958813", "-2.0137484", "-0.2044002", "0.724932", "-0.9518492", "1.8871258", "0.7306894", "-0.2425936", "-0.5782739", "0.19765162", "-1.3066089", "1.5833565", "1.3560302", "-0.26692554", "0.29375488", "-0.10668015", "-0.41316158", "0.40575314", "0.104809865", "0.60600543", "-1.7516258", "-0.31536034", "1.8050091", "1.1832459", "1.3771619", "1.128322", "0.8135872", "-1.836306", "-2.2223353", "-0.20601223", "-0.76685303", "0.57475924", "-0.2357972", "-0.75888956", "-1.8036778", "-0.5587863", "-2.795504", "0.30996308", "0.84836346", "0.031624373", "-0.56562036", "0.8487298", "-0.34204522", "-0.035959512", "0.34015474", "1.1412618", "-1.2982743", "-0.44775972", "-0.25934485", "-0.26788798", "-0.9558716", "0.6134913", "0.3106781", "0.62245697", "0.31867337", "-2.4236944", "0.2573793", "1.0573446", "-1.468752", "-0.80038816", "-1.0587021", "0.7490655", "1.6009762", "1.1651089", "0.38227117", "-0.8136667", "0.20392445", "-0.2633507", "0.38653633", "-0.33976826", "-1.7137729", "0.19399357", "-1.5969127", "-2.307667", "-0.91183615", "0.63920605", "0.1858523", "-0.85241497", "0.117894985", "1.2949679", "-0.052265976", "1.2236298", "-0.5696084", "1.5673447", "0.2753156", "2.201185", "0.12121282", "1.0758842", "-1.6835495", "-1.120238", "2.03855", "0.5832682", "-0.51239663", "-0.68237025", "0.256808", "-1.2486261", "-0.52110076", "0.5715046", "-0.5173119", "1.4776021", "-2.402802", "-1.3059962", "-0.003815812", "1.2231542", "-2.5033145", "1.2198472", "-0.30459356", "-1.4052606", "0.2034641", "-0.33905172", "-0.06537022", "0.5522327", "1.6823112", "0.9105171", "-0.6980024", "0.810816", "-0.19628756", "-1.3865594", "0.5176033", "-0.45992368", "0.026737818", "-0.8446818", "4.0577836", "0.43135685", "0.093359604", "0.7245583", "0.17340446", "1.0016552", "0.52363586", "-0.30043474", "-1.1640242", "0.13885887", "-2.744379", "-0.32339048", "-1.0052954", "1.6691679", "-2.2496154", "1.0443382", "0.45730805", "0.3523356", "0.8726594", "0.017295277", "-0.91214705", "-1.5869402", "1.0977314", "-0.0061134733", "0.93328506", "-1.2781295", "1.3121797", "-0.8824276"]}
