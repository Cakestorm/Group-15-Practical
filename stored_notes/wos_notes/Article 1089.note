{"body": "Canine brucellosis caused by Brucella canis is a neglected zoonosis worldwide and is a leading cause of reproductive failure in dogs, often causing substantial economic losses in breeding kennels. This study aimed to investigate the occurrence of B.canis infection in dogs of commercial breeding kennels located in SAo Paulo State, Brazil. A total of 753 dogs (183 males and 570 females) from 38 commercial kennels were clinically examined, and blood samples were collected for brucellosis diagnosis through blood culture. The association between clinical manifestations suggestive of brucellosis and positive results through blood culture was determined. Of the 753 dogs tested, 166 (22.0%) had at least one clinical sign suggestive of brucellosis and 158 (20.9%) had positive blood cultures. Seventy-two dogs had positive blood culture and had at least one clinical sign suggestive of brucellosis, while 91 dogs showed at least one clinical manifestation suggestive of brucellosis although blood culture was negative. Of the 38 kennels, 16 (42.1%) had at least one positive dog. The prevalence of infection in each kennel varied from 3.8% to 62.6%. Abortion/stillbirth, failure to conceive and enlargement of lymph nodes were significantly associated with brucellosis in female. No association of clinical signs and positive results in blood culture was observed in males. None of the kennels has been carrying out programmes to control brucellosis, and the sale of infected dogs was considered a common practice yielding risks to the public health, in view of the zoonotic potential of the infection.\n", "embeddings": ["0.50025445", "-1.5778489", "0.31096742", "0.20082374", "0.73267007", "0.41113943", "-0.75317204", "1.085171", "1.5823897", "-0.24604754", "-0.11736913", "0.99840987", "-0.12849666", "-0.22354037", "0.1152446", "-1.1866486", "0.6054804", "1.4438722", "-0.22191253", "-3.1307752", "-1.1651485", "-1.5632709", "0.0779326", "1.8548058", "1.5537527", "0.5510936", "0.61300606", "0.7968508", "-0.37049556", "-0.2621638", "1.5925525", "2.8337042", "-0.88372916", "-0.8786933", "-0.5939411", "-1.5860187", "-0.26279223", "-2.4350657", "0.5935362", "-0.86181194", "0.79898125", "0.035702787", "-0.5597401", "-2.436387", "1.7249178", "0.6326428", "0.15112475", "-1.3468062", "-0.21650267", "-0.31886646", "1.0836188", "-1.0244753", "0.20203376", "-0.58874625", "-1.4489621", "-0.46580312", "-0.07120634", "-0.43715477", "0.6281513", "-0.53501827", "-0.07166519", "-0.75800216", "1.4914982", "0.35894862", "0.49594855", "0.534673", "1.1124355", "2.2153711", "-0.74721074", "2.6721315", "-1.5720387", "1.5539228", "0.10937003", "-0.14998692", "0.72506934", "0.27795267", "2.474843", "-0.77797776", "0.23156168", "-0.47250536", "-1.1436434", "-1.2549068", "-0.119653665", "0.330994", "-0.6530907", "-1.0469047", "-1.466154", "1.4792217", "0.30228746", "0.038046867", "0.61475456", "-1.1714615", "1.6985879", "-0.1726127", "0.63164794", "-0.85707074", "-0.3563008", "0.41665247", "-0.36592937", "0.6310445", "0.28095046", "1.388465", "0.11942073", "-0.81370246", "-1.0971282", "-2.1272416", "-1.0918976", "2.2142503", "-2.1088612", "-0.86606985", "-1.3685956", "0.11248652", "-1.1197622", "0.20017134", "1.8892815", "-0.75980735", "0.37926984", "-0.84949577", "1.026475", "-0.7822903", "1.6936915", "-0.26761174", "1.5586259", "0.64954287", "0.26128563", "0.9790777", "1.1298258", "0.9529886", "-0.217582", "-0.7983966", "1.7540528", "0.6720886", "0.28924266", "-0.27308232", "-1.1585275", "-0.35720634", "-0.28572807", "-0.096468404", "-0.16000459", "-1.5929233", "0.6999032", "0.22858234", "-0.2627723", "-0.5001129", "-0.51307786", "-0.42764145", "-0.49145585", "0.20286176", "0.41914132", "-0.33987817", "-0.91337603", "-0.47188562", "0.29117805", "0.01069784", "-2.2558722", "0.21222834", "-0.8993177", "-0.95894355", "0.031533655", "-2.0809147", "-1.2271053", "0.6957955", "-2.4959636", "0.8007169", "-0.51747775", "0.6302255", "0.4283732", "-0.36123687", "-0.633536", "0.60582685", "-0.3098496", "-0.0124840615", "-0.6394792", "0.11290839", "0.0746534", "0.85242057", "-0.10875474", "0.6218609", "1.1201662", "-0.25112382", "-0.24620366", "1.1051837", "-0.6027747", "0.60601914", "0.6993862", "-0.62707263", "0.0411663", "-0.145142", "0.6763204", "0.060237672", "1.9665762", "-0.6835663", "-1.5335562", "0.689202", "0.11647038", "0.47013956", "-0.7537158", "-2.7182484", "-0.7989862", "0.074282825"]}
