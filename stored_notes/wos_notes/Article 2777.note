For specified conditions, the results show that energy and exergy efficiencies of the proposed multigeneration system are calculated about 34.98% and 49.17%, respectively. The highest and lowest total unit cost of the products estimated approximately 23.18 and 22.73 $/GJ, respectively, by considering that geothermal water temperature increases from 185 degrees C to 215 degrees C.
