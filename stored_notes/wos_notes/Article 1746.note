{"title": "Article 1746", "body": "Plant residues are one of the main sources of soil organic matter in paddy fields, and elucidation of the bacterial communities decomposing plant residues was important to understand their function and roles, as the microbial decomposition of plant residues is linked to soil fertility. We conducted a DNA stable isotope probing (SIP) experiment to elucidate the bacterial community assimilating 13-carbon (C-13) derived from plant residue under an anoxic soil condition. In addition, we compared the bacterial community with that under the oxic soil condition, which was elucidated in our previous study (Lee et al. in Soil Biol Biochem 43:814-822, 2011). We used the C-13-labeled dried rice callus cells as a model of rice plant residue. A paddy field soil was incubated with unlabeled and C-13-labeled callus cells. DNA extracted from the soils was subjected to buoyant density gradient centrifugation to fractionate C-13-enriched DNA. Then, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis of bacterial 16S rDNA band patterns and band sequencing method were used to evaluate bacterial community. DGGE analysis showed that the band patterns in the C-13-enriched fractions were distinctly changed over time, while the changes in the community structure before fractionation were minor. Sequencing of the C-13-labeled DGGE bands revealed that Clostridia were a major group in the bacterial communities incorporating the callus-derived carbon although Gram-negative bacteria, and Actinobacteria also participated in the carbon flow from the callus under the anoxic condition. The proportion of Gram-negative bacteria and Actinobacteria increased on 14 days after the onset of incubation, suggesting that the callus was decomposed by diverse bacterial members on this phase. When the bacterial groups incorporating the C-13 were compared between under anoxic and oxic soil conditions, the composition was largely different under the two opposite conditions. However, some members of Gram-negative bacteria were commonly found under the anoxic and oxic soil conditions. The majority of bacterial members assimilating the callus carbon was Clostridia in the soil under anoxic conditions. However, several Gram-negative bacterial members, such as Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria, also participated in the decomposition of callus under anoxic soil conditions. Our study showed that carbon flow into the diverse bacterial members during the callus decomposition and the distinctiveness of the bacterial communities was formed under the anoxic and oxic soil conditions.\n", "text": "Plant residues are one of the main sources of soil organic matter in paddy fields, and elucidation of the bacterial communities decomposing plant residues was important to understand their function and roles, as the microbial decomposition of plant residues is linked to soil fertility.
