{"body": "Fiber optical gyro (FOG) is a kind of solid-state optical gyroscope with good environmental adaptability, which has been widely used in national defense, aviation, aerospace and other civilian areas. In some applications, FOG will experience environmental conditions such as vacuum, radiation, vibration and so on, and the scale-factor performance is concerned as an important accuracy indicator. However, the scale-factor performance of FOG under these environmental conditions is difficult to test using conventional methods, as the turntable can't work under these environmental conditions. According to the phenomenon that the physical effects of FOG produced by the sawtooth voltage signal under static conditions is consistent with the physical effects of FOG produced by a turntable in uniform rotation, a new method for the scale-factor performance test of FOG without turntable is proposed in this paper. In this method, the test system of the scale-factor performance is constituted by an external operational amplifier circuit and a FOG which the modulation signal and Y waveguied are disconnected. The external operational amplifier circuit is used to superimpose the externally generated sawtooth voltage signal and the modulation signal of FOG, and to exert the superimposed signal on the Y waveguide of the FOG. The test system can produce different equivalent angular velocities by changing the cycle of the sawtooth signal in the scale-factor performance test. In this paper, the system model of FOG superimposed with an externally generated sawtooth is analyzed, and a conclusion that the effect of the equivalent input angular velocity produced by the sawtooth voltage signal is consistent with the effect of input angular velocity produced by the turntable is obtained. The relationship between the equivalent angular velocity and the parameters such as sawtooth cycle and so on is presented, and the correction method for the equivalent angular velocity is also presented by analyzing the influence of each parameter error on the equivalent angular velocity. A comparative experiment of the method proposed in this paper and the method of turntable calibration was conducted, and the scale-factor performance test results of the same FOG using the two methods were consistent. Using the method proposed in this paper to test the scale-factor performance of FOG, the input angular velocity is the equivalent effect produced by a sawtooth voltage signal, and there is no need to use a turntable to produce mechanical rotation, so this method can be used to test the performance of FOG at the ambient conditions which turntable can not work.\n", "embeddings": ["2.0763676", "-1.7846987", "1.3246586", "-1.1455299", "-0.10697985", "0.06881775", "1.0496881", "0.9828295", "0.22803695", "0.7626126", "-0.24317938", "-0.09800501", "0.39338323", "2.4251506", "-2.4527736", "0.5602387", "-0.25131813", "-0.197319", "-1.2797061", "0.91264117", "0.111179635", "0.3335192", "0.35168362", "0.17171945", "-1.4058597", "-0.6418516", "0.38022482", "-1.443356", "-3.5180724", "-1.8845987", "2.164785", "2.0086257", "0.93355656", "-1.8827757", "-0.73360074", "2.4683447", "0.737754", "0.5999029", "1.4268539", "0.68075544", "0.21354437", "0.86524963", "1.0791687", "-2.4376843", "-0.5707276", "-2.380951", "0.67753464", "2.3656912", "0.8848962", "2.4152784", "2.931102", "-0.36301458", "1.3571988", "-1.0450997", "0.2224752", "-0.25029725", "-0.6208626", "-1.9843744", "-0.31484228", "0.22537339", "0.06800883", "0.612635", "1.7229134", "-0.9735079", "-2.5540445", "1.7598461", "-0.3010218", "0.23042496", "0.85873944", "0.039617784", "-1.114213", "-1.0575963", "-0.12309469", "1.2633413", "-0.08957234", "0.14947411", "0.5569945", "-0.5854556", "-2.1150534", "0.15148789", "0.93838835", "1.0904803", "-1.9924862", "1.5999562", "0.553683", "0.5249101", "0.12561502", "-0.1625387", "1.4490945", "2.5197906", "-0.6554781", "-0.6823938", "-0.608427", "-0.3363816", "-1.1718127", "2.556502", "-0.653739", "2.0970385", "-0.285309", "0.24357836", "-0.10245359", "1.0099322", "0.98719794", "0.5288163", "0.9469152", "-1.9991771", "0.45103946", "2.406015", "-0.03580274", "-0.41936553", "-0.2760788", "0.94155073", "0.92047966", "2.7541957", "-0.35272977", "0.31533664", "0.39541668", "0.9557108", "0.09323635", "0.9786399", "-0.13735667", "3.0231745", "-0.985656", "-2.3347576", "1.3718314", "-2.056487", "-2.6485288", "-1.6856607", "0.09950877", "-0.5369845", "0.5209732", "-0.2033755", "1.8606627", "-1.5988864", "0.58663744", "0.63563937", "-0.38201854", "0.45779568", "-1.1913679", "-0.39907497", "-0.34074098", "0.96158254", "-2.7881153", "-0.9176215", "-0.602672", "1.641582", "-0.0037790346", "-0.3025301", "0.74498737", "1.2705538", "-0.2271493", "-1.1379954", "-1.1944586", "1.0698065", "-0.85439056", "1.3276285", "-1.388703", "-0.46513554", "-1.0947926", "2.3296635", "0.60098433", "2.1337147", "1.029111", "-0.95202756", "-0.73696053", "-1.0017337", "0.94374305", "-2.368039", "-0.19857873", "-0.75627786", "0.63793826", "1.2792164", "0.95339996", "1.0474766", "0.20573017", "-1.7975922", "0.6170349", "0.32136226", "0.82499003", "-0.6309815", "-1.3554564", "0.5818776", "0.8584557", "-0.6892533", "-2.2594814", "3.277884", "-0.90419114", "0.13439271", "2.3016057", "0.5583332", "1.5754929", "-0.2958966", "0.023913974", "-1.9437728", "-1.8771739", "1.0846827", "2.2484608", "-0.7281797", "-0.19399925", "0.3383191"]}
