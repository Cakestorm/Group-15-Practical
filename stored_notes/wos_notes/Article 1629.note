However, further studies in animals and several clinical trials in children must be performed before new vaccines become licensed.\n"}]}, "text": "Introduction: The success of the vaccines available on the market has significantly increased interest in vaccine development.Areas covered: The main aim of this paper is to discuss the most important vaccines of pediatric interest that are currently being developed.
