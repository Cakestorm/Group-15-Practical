{"title": "Article 1918", "body": {"ops": [{"insert": "Condyloma acuminata (CA) are warty lesions caused by human papilloma virus (HPV) that generally affect the external genitalia and mucocutaneous junctions. Involvement of the urinary tract is rare, and involvement of the urinary bladder is thought to be due to immunosuppression. A 30-year-old woman was diagnosed with urethral CA 12 months after renal transplantation. She underwent transurethral resection (TUR) of the urethral lesions. During the operation, multiple sessile warty lesions were found incidentally inside the bladder and were also removed by TUR. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful. Pathological examination confirmed that the lesions were CA. Multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed to confirm the HPV genotype and revealed type 45 HPV DNA. CA of the urethra are uncommon, and bladder involvement is extremely rare. This case is the first reported, to our knowledge, to involve HPV type 45 in bladder condyloma. TUR may be the preferred option for the management of CA in the urinary bladder.\n"}]}, "text": "Condyloma acuminata (CA) are warty lesions caused by human papilloma virus (HPV) that generally affect the external genitalia and mucocutaneous junctions.
