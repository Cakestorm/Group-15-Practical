{"title": "Article 1705", "body": "In the present article we report europium-doped strontium ortho-silicates, namely Sr2SiO4:xEu(3+) (x=1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5 or 3.0mol%) phosphors, prepared by solid state reaction method. The crystal structures of the sintered phosphors were consistent with orthorhombic crystallography with a Pmna space group. The chemical compositions of the sintered phosphors were confirmed by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Thermoluminescence (TL) kinetic parameters such as activation energy, order of kinetics and frequency factors were calculated by the peak shape method. Orange-red emission originating from the D-5(0)-F-7(J) (J=0, 1, 2, 3) transitions of Eu3+ ions could clearly be observed after samples were excited at 395nm. The combination of these emissions constituted orange-red light as indicated on the Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) chromaticity diagram. Mechanoluminescence (ML) intensity of the prepared phosphor increased linearly with increasing impact velocity of the moving piston that suggests that these phosphors can also be used as sensors to detect the stress of an object. Thus, the present investigation indicates that the piezo-electricity was responsible for producing ML in the prepared phosphor.\n", "text": "In the present article we report europium-doped strontium ortho-silicates, namely Sr2SiO4:xEu(3+) (x=1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5 or 3.0mol%) phosphors, prepared by solid state reaction method.
