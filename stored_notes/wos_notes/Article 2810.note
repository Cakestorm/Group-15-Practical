{"title": "Article 2810", "body": "Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP; Mendelian of Inherintance in Man ID, 175100) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the development of numerous adenomatous polyps throughout the colon and rectum associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer. FAP is at time accompanied with certain extraintestinal manifestations such as congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium, dental disorders and desmoid tumors. It is caused by mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene. The present study reported on a Chinese family with FAP. Polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing of the full coding sequence of the APC gene were performed to identify the mutation in this family. A nonsense mutation of the APC gene was identified in this pedigree. It is a heterozygous G>T substitution at position 2,971 in exon 15 of the APC gene, which formed a premature stop codon at amino acid residue 991 (p.Glu991*). The resulting truncated protein lacked 1,853 amino acids. The present study expanded the database on APC gene mutations in FAP and enriched the spectrum of known germline mutations of the APC gene. Prophylactic proctocolectomy may be considered as a possible treatment for carriers of the mutation.\n", "text": "Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP; Mendelian of Inherintance in Man ID, 175100) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the development of numerous adenomatous polyps throughout the colon and rectum associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer.
