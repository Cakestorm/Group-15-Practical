{"title": "Article 2834", "body": "In grid-connected converter control, grid voltage feedforward is usually introduced to suppress the influence of grid voltage distortion on the converter's grid-side AC current. However, owing to the time-delay in control systems, the suppression effect of the grid voltage distortion is seriously affected. In this paper, the positive effects of the grid voltage feedforward control are analyzed in detail, and the time-delay caused by the low-pass filter (LPF) in the voltage filtering circuits and digital control are summarized. In order to reduce the time-delay effect on the performance of the feedforward control, a voltage feedforward control strategy with time-delay compensation is proposed, in which, a leading correction of the feedforward voltage is used. The optimal leading step used in this strategy is derived from analyzing the phase-frequency characteristics of a LPF and the implementation of digital control. By using the optimal leading step, the delay in the feedforward path can be further counteracted so that the performance of the feedforward control in terms of suppressing the influence of grid voltage distortion on the converter output current can be improved. The validity of the proposed method is verified through simulation and experiment results.\n", "text": "In grid-connected converter control, grid voltage feedforward is usually introduced to suppress the influence of grid voltage distortion on the converter's grid-side AC current.
