To meet the requirement of the uniform velocity of moving mirror scanning, a completely digital control scheme is proposed with FPGA as the key hardware, and this scheme is applied to the moving mirror movement in the spectrometer.

The experiment results show that the current curve is smooth in the uniform scan phase of moving mirror, and that the peak current is 0.5 A in acceleration and deceleration period. Additionally, when the angular velocity of moving mirror is 30/s in the uniform section, the maximum relative error is less than 4%. From research results, it can be drawn that the digital control strategy can significantly improve the velocity stability of moving mirror, and meet the performance requirements of the control system.
