The proposed HiEMS optimizes the multimarket bids considering a realistic BESS performance model, and coordinates the BESSs and manages their state of charge values, according to their price penalties based on dynamically generated annualized cost. By taking part in the energy market and regulation market at the same time, the cost-performance index (CPI) of the BESS aggregation is greatly improved.
