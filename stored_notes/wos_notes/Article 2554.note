Results indicate that forest owners' social networks currently serve only a minimal function of sharing knowledge of climate change and adaptation.

In conclusion we suggest those actors that forest owners' most frequently communicate with, especially forestry experts providing advisory services (e.g. forest owner associations, companies, and authorities) have a clear role to communicate both the risks of climate change and opportunities for adaptation.
