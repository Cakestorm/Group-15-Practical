Proliferation and phagocytosis of peripheral blood, splenic, and epigonal leukocytes were assessed. Percent phagocytosis and mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) were evaluated by quantifying % leukocytes positive for, and relative amounts of ingested fluorescent E. coli BioParticles. Total cell proliferation differed between sites, with mainland rays having a higher cell concentration in whole blood. Sigma PCB load explained significantly higher % phagocytosis in blood of mainland rays, while Sigma PCB and Sigma pesticide loads described increased splenic % phagocytosis and MFI in the mainland population.
