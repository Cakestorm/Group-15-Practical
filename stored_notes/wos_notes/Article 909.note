{"title": "Article 909", "body": "This study examines whether the delivery of three components, (a) exercise training, (b) behavior management skill building, and (c) dementia-related education, in an evidence-based program are differentially associated with changes in outcomes for individuals with dementia (IWDs) after 3 months. Data come from 508 IWDs participating in the community replication of the evidence-based Reducing Disability in Alzheimer's Disease program. Regression results indicate that after 3 months, more exercise sessions are associated with improvements in physical functioning, mobility, minutes exercising, and symptoms of depression; more dementia education sessions are related to fewer restricted activity days; and more behavior management sessions are related to more symptoms of depression. As resource-strapped agencies look to best serve participants, further analysis and consideration is needed to determine the ideal balance of program efficacy, feasibility, and resources, as well as program benefits for IWDs and caregivers.\n", "text": "This study examines whether the delivery of three components, (a) exercise training, (b) behavior management skill building, and (c) dementia-related education, in an evidence-based program are differentially associated with changes in outcomes for individuals with dementia (IWDs) after 3 months.
