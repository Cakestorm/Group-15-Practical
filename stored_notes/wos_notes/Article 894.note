{"title": "Article 894", "body": "In current brain computer interfacing (BCI) system is used for many applications. This technology also used for capturing brain signals in the form of EEG. This technique have intensive applications in non-invasive technique of signal capturing, Due to its temporal resolution, low set-up cost, easy portability compared to all other techniques. In the EEG technique, as we are dealing with very low frequency signals, these signals have plagued with various noise and interferences, so there is an urge for designing and implementing an accurate and stabilized system for acquiring these low frequency signals. This paper is aiming for VLSI design and testing of EEG acquisition system to acquire brain signals. Initially the low power and high gain generalized operational amplifier is designed. Later a suitable filter is designed to eliminate the noise signals produced in low frequency operations, in order to capture EEG signals. The generalized amplifier design of this system consists of differential amplifier followed with voltage follower circuit. The above circuit is designed using the Cadence tool which facilitates the capturing of transient response and generation of virtual layouts. Each and every blocks of the system is designed and tested individually, for each blocks virtual layouts are generated. And the transient response of the system which contains EEG signals with different voltage levels and frequencies are captured.\n", "text": "In current brain computer interfacing (BCI) system is used for many applications.
