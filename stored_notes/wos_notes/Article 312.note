{"body": "Background and aimsHIV-infected people with substance use disorders are least likely to benefit from advances in HIV treatment. Integration of extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) into HIV clinics may increase engagement in the HIV care continuum by decreasing substance use. We aimed to compare (1) XR-NTX treatment initiation, (2) retention and (3) safety of XR-NTX versus treatment as usual (TAU) for treating opioid use disorder (OUD) and/or alcohol use disorder (AUD) in HIV clinics. DesignNon-blinded randomized trial of XR-NTX versus pharmacotherapy TAU. SettingHIV primary care clinics in Vancouver, BC, Canada and Chicago, IL, USA. ParticipantsFifty-one HIV-infected patients seeking treatment for OUD (n=16), AUD (n=27) or both OUD and AUD (n=8). MeasurementsPrimary outcomes were XR-NTX initiation (receipt of first injection within 4weeks of randomization) and retention at 16weeks. Secondary outcomes generated point estimates for change in substance use, HIV viral suppression [HIV RNA polymerase chain reaction (pcr)<200 copies/ml] and safety. FindingsTwo-thirds (68%) of participants assigned to XR-NTX initiated treatment, and 88% of these were retained on XR-NTX at 16weeks. In comparison, 96% of TAU participants initiated treatment, but only 50% were retained on medication at 16weeks. Mean days of opioid use in past 30 days decreased from 17.3 to 4.1 for TAU and from 20.3 to 7.7 for XR-NTX. Mean heavy drinking days decreased from 15.6 to 5.7 for TAU and 12.5 to 2.8 for XR-NTX. Among those with OUD, HIV suppression improved from 67 to 80% for XR-NTX and 58 to 75% for TAU. XR-NTX was well tolerated, with no precipitated withdrawals and one serious injection-site reaction. ConclusionsExtended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) is feasible and safe for treatment of opioid use disorder and alcohol use disorder in HIV clinics. Treatment initiation appears to be lower and retention greater for XR-NTX compared with treatment as usual ( NCT01908062).\n", "embeddings": ["0.6046239", "-2.1029923", "0.63019955", "2.3532782", "0.16693404", "-1.3658141", "-0.6035556", "1.2162242", "-1.0291066", "0.54817516", "0.43329775", "-1.7752619", "-0.9603207", "-1.0388906", "-1.7585914", "-0.7747291", "0.11368829", "2.1988297", "-0.79833996", "-2.151208", "-1.1666517", "1.0610873", "0.20266639", "-2.3603673", "0.4196739", "0.17920192", "1.2065732", "1.7654763", "-0.4038515", "-0.57302934", "-0.21619163", "1.3026477", "0.68467486", "1.2390876", "-0.82153714", "-0.34815845", "-0.10529748", "-0.58782035", "0.9846377", "-1.111841", "-0.9835858", "0.76773757", "0.6750644", "-1.7135183", "-0.4193985", "-0.14718807", "-0.4612363", "-0.25791165", "0.13870656", "-0.39536878", "1.1230679", "-0.8015067", "-1.1518519", "0.76840395", "1.5651308", "0.7878195", "-0.14769445", "0.5505561", "-0.89615214", "1.6336758", "1.2302797", "0.06749508", "-0.9767774", "-0.5215021", "0.6488484", "-0.7386497", "0.4110518", "0.89871055", "-1.7381743", "3.1379192", "0.82094544", "-0.27101213", "1.1777606", "0.3605792", "-0.9091625", "1.7632807", "0.1749675", "-0.24191687", "-1.0205909", "0.8176592", "0.37136632", "0.9151236", "0.597988", "0.5562497", "-2.0011528", "-1.1954639", "-1.6714388", "-0.7120666", "-1.4967134", "0.675123", "1.572759", "1.6000799", "-0.86571985", "-0.38829923", "-0.3335428", "-0.1296798", "-0.77821463", "-0.25663465", "0.84197146", "0.82562935", "-0.46233884", "0.08887091", "-0.65742934", "-0.37259218", "-1.2803756", "-0.62544584", "-0.34356907", "2.3703642", "0.52199304", "-2.157227", "-0.8239562", "0.21141976", "-1.1266594", "-0.552937", "0.33133042", "-0.013862962", "0.45838702", "-2.3378198", "0.85410845", "0.96395254", "-1.473327", "-1.3245553", "0.8680371", "-1.619052", "0.8739325", "0.13462661", "-1.2546214", "0.3551201", "0.6040642", "-0.053743474", "-0.045440234", "-0.64225143", "0.1272813", "-0.44544628", "-0.12046463", "0.32151622", "-0.8546159", "-0.87617475", "0.13145134", "-1.5577357", "-0.7190618", "-2.2183604", "0.13825879", "-0.5573748", "0.81898063", "0.20299637", "0.22242539", "0.97613406", "-1.2894855", "1.848303", "0.36526546", "-1.6518668", "-0.4648699", "0.9103977", "-0.8573331", "0.2852892", "0.38943696", "0.8925979", "0.42996922", "-0.47336093", "-0.5048814", "1.7211318", "-0.004944625", "0.08793131", "-0.7963101", "1.2316393", "-0.51022935", "-0.2674055", "-1.9637275", "-0.34119692", "1.0602105", "0.4943497", "-1.1753483", "0.1464433", "0.11972995", "2.6397922", "-0.97864205", "0.6585258", "2.0419335", "-0.73938555", "-0.12909535", "1.7170777", "-0.43072626", "0.041875403", "2.6048794", "-0.11335875", "-2.2056773", "1.3875114", "1.0147678", "0.5990061", "2.354001", "0.81100965", "-1.2803609", "0.4130894", "-0.93570507", "-0.7163111", "-0.24438092", "0.52627337", "1.3879771", "-0.8540242"]}
