This writer examines Cheit's conclusions in light of her own experience as a career prosecutor of crimes against children as well as her involvement in a high-profile day care case encompassed by the witch-hunt narrative. Setting the record straight about these cases is important not only for the sake of historical accuracy and intellectual honesty but also because the witch-hunt narrative's unwarranted assertions about the suggestibility of children have had a negative effect on society's perception of their credibility. Bringing public attention to the fallacies of the witch-hunt narrative and shining a light on questionable tactics used by some in academia to support their contention that all children are highly suggestible will ultimately serve to strengthen society's ability to believe a child who discloses sexual abuse.\n"}]}, "text": "For more than two decades, conventional wisdom about the high-profile day care cases of the 1980s and early 1990s suggests all were modern-day witch hunts, based on false allegations made by highly suggestible children during an era when society was gripped by a \"believe the children\" hysteria.
