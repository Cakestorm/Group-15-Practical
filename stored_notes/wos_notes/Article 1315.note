{"body": "Background: Antimicrobial resistance is a global public health challenge and carbapenem resistance, in particular, is considered an urgent global health threat. This study was carried out to give a bibliometric overview of literature on carbapenem resistance. In specific, number of publications, top productive countries and institutes, highly cited articles, citation analysis, co-authorships, international collaboration, top active authors, and journals publishing articles on carbapenem resistance were analyzed and discussed. Methods: Specific keywords pertaining to carbapenem resistance were used in Scopus database. Quantitative and qualitative analysis of retrieved data were presented using appropriate bibliometric indicators and visualization maps. Results: A total of 2617 journal articles were retrieved. The average number of citations per article was of 21.47. The growth of publications showed a dramatic increase from 2008 to 2015. Approximately 9 % of retrieved articles on carbapenem resistance were published in Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy journal. Retrieved articles were published by 102 different countries. The United States of America (USA) contributed most with 437 (16.70 %) articles followed by China with 257 (9.82 %) articles. When productivity was stratified by population size, Greece ranked first followed by France. Greece also ranked first when data were stratified by gross domestic product (GDP). Asian countries have lesser international collaboration compared with other countries in the top ten list. Five of top ten productive institutes were Europeans (France, the UK, Greece, Italy, and Switzerland) and two were Asians (China and South Korea). Other active institutes included an Israeli and a Brazilian institute. Four of the top ten cited articles were published in Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy journal and two were published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases. Conclusion: There was a dramatic increase in number of publications on carbapenem resistance in the past few years. These publications were produced from different world regions including Asia, Europe, Middle East, and Latin America. International collaboration needs to be encouraged particularly for researchers in Asia. Molecular biology and epidemiology dominated the theme of the top ten cited articles on carbapenem resistance. This bibliometric study will hopefully help health policy makers in planning future research and allocating funds pertaining to carbapenem resistance.\n", "embeddings": ["-2.6532104", "0.13034146", "0.21409523", "-0.3427685", "0.9699396", "-0.106548905", "1.0346287", "0.20390393", "-0.89898634", "-0.26557925", "-1.2467397", "-2.3803086", "-1.0569079", "-0.061587587", "1.15298", "-1.3436086", "0.20778885", "-0.79011816", "-0.6466964", "-0.71130866", "-2.1228561", "-1.7741371", "-0.19866267", "1.384439", "0.7785122", "-1.7151058", "-0.08169897", "-2.545039", "-1.1850847", "-1.4095435", "0.81702", "0.9738713", "-0.10944673", "-0.15646215", "-0.037690584", "0.103453934", "-1.0365202", "-1.5206509", "2.2576344", "-0.74611473", "-1.0159726", "0.87279385", "-0.59557265", "-2.3818567", "0.9537297", "-0.3692767", "0.07978781", "-0.3465599", "1.1734843", "-0.082840174", "-1.384095", "0.566432", "1.4937465", "-0.41085035", "0.014179061", "-0.3942182", "0.41498688", "-1.6359266", "0.27750868", "-0.09655081", "0.1346284", "1.705017", "1.6075889", "-1.1819762", "0.46570307", "-0.5768708", "-0.28287086", "0.91738313", "-1.94972", "-0.908601", "-0.79799396", "-0.52690923", "-0.31769595", "2.1410153", "0.58580613", "0.21636783", "3.9737673", "1.7321767", "-0.7569962", "0.25838593", "-0.8597897", "0.11651302", "-0.9768648", "0.9395749", "0.4844365", "-0.053984556", "-1.1247891", "1.1361421", "-0.017176664", "0.16307318", "-0.113874756", "0.029152311", "0.90228146", "-0.3376396", "1.4746791", "-0.6923835", "-0.9948986", "0.8757196", "-0.111904934", "-0.37591738", "0.53772426", "0.1893348", "-0.15298362", "0.15984957", "-2.7062726", "-1.4393831", "0.40832052", "2.435343", "-1.8327035", "0.19718188", "-0.21632819", "0.0081208795", "-1.459331", "1.2373481", "1.4535674", "2.161151", "0.3475349", "-0.9356767", "-0.33524013", "-1.106176", "0.32825768", "0.45495102", "-0.0030519827", "0.40095258", "-0.2799882", "1.311577", "0.48889074", "-0.118748754", "-0.9358348", "0.72631127", "2.4032595", "-0.7321133", "2.0028775", "-0.021513306", "0.34349856", "0.39633185", "-0.29362667", "-0.82643306", "-0.10581146", "-1.022216", "-1.3093582", "0.27700797", "-1.1265692", "0.44262746", "-0.22498421", "1.1351583", "-0.34658447", "0.09803568", "0.900059", "0.66953754", "-0.17989644", "1.6225888", "0.51883984", "-1.2035359", "-0.9074155", "0.9343323", "-0.9721496", "1.3846014", "0.5099578", "-1.3691286", "-0.26627094", "2.290126", "-1.5967236", "-2.0766807", "0.7794323", "1.8159217", "0.16027778", "-1.3326316", "-0.45531774", "0.31884", "-1.9941031", "-0.7831404", "1.3058748", "0.039871134", "1.5258311", "-0.9053775", "0.46481872", "-0.054514106", "1.4681214", "-0.23896277", "0.2762158", "1.2917182", "2.6517947", "2.596795", "-0.13319777", "0.452074", "1.0292857", "0.8940083", "2.167729", "-0.92556965", "-0.50832397", "-1.2484168", "-1.3341995", "-1.9176911", "-0.8961258", "-0.96240056", "0.74859107", "1.0598727", "-0.82956326", "-0.2740064"]}
