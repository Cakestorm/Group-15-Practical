{"title": "Article 2674", "body": "In this work a photovoltaic energy station system is proposed. Power converters are designed to transfer energy between source, storage and underwater autonomous vehicle (AUV) load plus variable load station. Efficient regulation of the energy is achieved by linear control PI to track DC bus voltage. Energy management has a power configuration composed of DC-DC converters with digital-control using a Matlab software in order to do calculations. The mathematical formulation of system is analyzed to local stability and controlability. Gains of PI controllers are choice through two methods: Siso-tool of Matlab and stability gain analysis based on the transfer function. Stability proof analysis of converters is demonstrated by Routh Hurwitz even variation load station. Simulation evidence results of the performance improvement are shown.\n", "text": "In this work a photovoltaic energy station system is proposed.
