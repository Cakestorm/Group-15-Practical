{"body": "Objectives. TNF-alpha, IL-1 and IL-6 are known to have primary roles in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory diseases. The anti-rheumatic drug chloroquine has been shown to inhibit TNF-alpha, IL-1 and IL-6 production from mononuclear phagocytes. We examined the underlying mechanisms involved in the chloroquine-induced inhibition of cytokine production. Methods. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and monocytes/macrophages and monocytic U-937 and THP-1 cells were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide, and TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta and IL-6 production was measured by ELISA. Levels of mRNA were measured by northern blotting and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Synthesis of 26-kDa TNF-alpha precursor was measured by metabolic labelling and immunoprecipitation analysis. Transcription rate was determined by nuclear run-on assay. Results. TNF-alpha release from the cells was inhibited by chloroquine, whereas the steady-state level of TNF-alpha mRNA and synthesis of 26-kDa TNF-alpha precursor were not changed by chloroquine. In contrast, chloroquine-induced inhibition of IL-1 beta and IL-6 release was accompanied by a decrease in their steady-state mRNA levels. The transcription rates of the IL-1 beta and IL-6 genes were not changed by chloroquine, whereas the stability of IL-1 beta and IL-6 mRNA was decreased by chloroquine. Weak-base amines such as methylamine and ammonium chloride had no effect on the production of TNF-alpha, whereas they partially blocked the production of IL-1 beta and IL-6. Conclusions. Our results indicate that chloroquine-mediated inhibition of TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta and IL-6 synthesis occurs through different modes in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated human monocytes/macrophages: it blocks the conversion of cell-associated TNF-alpha precursor to mature soluble protein, whereas it reduces the levels of IL-1 beta and IL-6 mRNA, at least in part, by decreasing their stability and by a pH-dependent mechanism.\n", "embeddings": ["0.8243103", "0.7681792", "-0.034869496", "-1.1897396", "1.9242249", "-0.67579275", "-1.3552946", "1.3927789", "-0.556466", "0.9027354", "-0.24464266", "-0.6452535", "0.17447455", "2.1031992", "-0.41046643", "0.24383001", "1.8324549", "0.6238895", "-0.061059684", "-1.5325837", "0.93592006", "-0.78758264", "0.10740232", "0.4149919", "-0.6085994", "-1.3861552", "0.5425518", "1.519225", "-0.21296121", "-0.18379131", "0.36360422", "0.47937328", "-0.2909114", "0.039540917", "0.36873057", "-0.29339933", "0.47867414", "0.43600368", "0.22635612", "-0.14554395", "-0.5452593", "-0.4150957", "-1.452358", "-1.828051", "1.4957823", "-1.1489484", "2.285848", "-0.071266055", "0.8124631", "1.4935445", "0.9991708", "-0.91479367", "-0.61882615", "-1.4662766", "-0.21499074", "-0.32590804", "-0.38879603", "-0.9445103", "-1.2973095", "2.171901", "1.0453663", "-0.5613949", "1.515311", "-0.7295445", "-0.97031814", "0.77801543", "1.2664086", "-0.21552868", "-0.63979656", "-0.6018359", "-0.9038149", "-0.7481081", "0.3973635", "-0.25900158", "-0.47537968", "-0.032535452", "0.57347906", "0.1621579", "-0.44267035", "0.074300565", "-0.027392613", "-0.029351933", "-1.2174971", "0.26023686", "-0.17817518", "-0.38965327", "0.6833045", "0.30142218", "1.4860417", "1.0648261", "1.5435184", "0.858186", "0.09412687", "-0.32665694", "0.76738775", "0.3824861", "-0.5258082", "-1.1176481", "1.0591053", "0.35914576", "-0.44191796", "1.469581", "0.3996375", "-1.2100357", "-0.3150124", "0.16482636", "0.55655193", "1.1221412", "-0.6915734", "0.4224574", "-0.39245147", "0.35068777", "-0.18860531", "-0.90610856", "0.74499804", "-1.1046157", "-0.08974264", "-0.36489066", "-0.90074503", "0.88269377", "0.6126243", "0.9491022", "-0.5015205", "-0.5689881", "1.2709192", "0.038578715", "0.044655137", "-1.6212928", "0.9480039", "-0.5865936", "0.19174545", "-1.1140454", "0.8772421", "-1.3593051", "-0.19111788", "0.6587279", "-0.68162745", "2.1931405", "-1.5357562", "-1.800922", "0.19924527", "-0.6761936", "1.5514344", "0.25579822", "0.7050316", "-0.092809156", "-1.3483819", "-0.2670774", "-0.13860057", "2.1765382", "0.50122786", "-0.43201622", "-0.6389244", "0.14488314", "-0.82874507", "0.030781249", "-1.5727636", "0.9970077", "-0.03930714", "1.301704", "0.31303057", "0.49114856", "-0.53595996", "-1.0440778", "0.28869316", "0.29878154", "0.9103999", "0.6749818", "-0.7961075", "-0.5673299", "-0.10184561", "0.6567997", "-0.77291226", "1.1690862", "-0.316805", "-0.74806255", "0.79200757", "-0.37873212", "0.44642878", "0.242925", "-0.3958462", "-0.085689574", "1.4073665", "2.1185129", "1.2610307", "-0.4568684", "-0.8350667", "0.8423594", "0.38250935", "0.1574041", "-0.20815608", "-0.045030836", "-0.47415963", "0.5141032", "0.74194026", "0.96448904", "1.2770525", "-0.77538824", "0.43581733", "0.37476182"]}
