{"body": "Introduction: The goal of replantation after dental avulsion is to maintain the tooth in its socket. Presence of vital periodontal ligament cells on the root surface of the replanted tooth and the immunologic status of the patient are factors that protect against root resorption. It is known that dental constituents play an active role in root resorption by inducing specific and non-specific immune responses; however, little information exists regarding the influence of the acquired immune response on replantation. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the 5-year outcome of replantation in non-atopic and atopic patients. Methods: Clinical and radiographic examinations were performed in 62 replanted teeth during a 5-year period. The evaluation of atopy was based on the patients' personal and family histories and skin prick test results. The X-2 and the Z tests were used to assess the association between atopy and the outcome of the replanted teeth (P < .05). Results: There were significant differences between the 1-year and 5-year outcomes of the replanted teeth (P < .05) and atopic and non-atopic patients who had their teeth extracted because of inflammatory or replacement root resorption after 5 years (P < .05). Conclusions: Being atopic may offer the advantage of loss of fewer teeth because of replacement resorption, whereas being non-atopic may create an advantage of loss of fewer teeth because of inflammatory root resorption during the first 5 years after trauma.\n", "embeddings": ["-1.5888215", "0.9982732", "-0.12633471", "-1.0214179", "1.5581502", "-0.8731568", "-0.3668108", "0.7964347", "0.7529916", "0.17065768", "-0.019859074", "-0.5655284", "-0.13329744", "0.7509451", "-0.13122222", "-0.2818253", "-0.42744535", "-0.56250244", "1.419304", "-1.6172194", "0.599526", "-0.11711056", "0.9737202", "-0.09931277", "-0.06570621", "-0.8589816", "1.0379062", "0.16893423", "-1.8557829", "-0.92620224", "0.062081687", "-1.2227141", "1.8546069", "-0.11274241", "0.93222183", "0.84246516", "-0.33483732", "0.14151427", "0.40476066", "-1.0179732", "0.44706786", "0.14061777", "-1.491156", "-0.16419339", "0.792116", "0.4579059", "-0.386912", "0.11059393", "-0.27458572", "0.065723434", "-0.016521005", "-0.31445643", "0.13998936", "-0.9066435", "0.89982885", "1.7951849", "0.6600165", "1.9110197", "1.4055105", "-1.4824188", "-0.5040475", "1.7660035", "-0.18940142", "-0.52479064", "-1.0722729", "0.39905402", "-0.25642633", "1.0484694", "-0.5488332", "1.2568674", "-0.4803461", "0.8152534", "1.0803316", "-0.20613123", "0.2860515", "1.8042401", "1.2329298", "-0.25043213", "-2.734895", "-0.9685719", "0.22167338", "-1.314346", "0.21704783", "1.5429237", "-0.24341927", "-2.2750964", "1.8662412", "-1.7306623", "-0.4695787", "-1.5166823", "-0.5988694", "-1.277573", "0.09659146", "-0.720904", "1.3168952", "1.3892212", "1.0420514", "1.2228125", "0.2230628", "1.1217753", "-0.27686948", "2.0147085", "0.84369576", "0.6048805", "-0.93728906", "-2.733625", "-1.6750937", "2.9295304", "-0.29574442", "-0.18118045", "0.05186425", "-0.83214426", "-0.33994627", "0.47829416", "-0.6878869", "-0.17389947", "1.081039", "-0.11079162", "0.03374828", "-1.4408349", "-0.96313405", "0.94332", "1.009615", "0.4950353", "0.83010584", "-0.62163377", "0.8451398", "-0.28097516", "0.75175536", "-0.16125958", "2.5596998", "1.3417358", "0.48786914", "-0.29083714", "-0.40459165", "0.6366638", "0.2557242", "1.330901", "-0.5936713", "-0.26724228", "0.5763811", "1.2279658", "-1.2797337", "-1.284847", "-0.3014549", "0.8697715", "0.6934194", "-0.77777714", "1.1868614", "1.1335843", "0.424921", "0.36135092", "-1.612776", "0.8086148", "-0.85849214", "-0.4856335", "0.13951232", "0.3275392", "-0.26707008", "0.31962588", "0.28808263", "1.4849566", "1.4276297", "0.48638102", "-0.87766427", "0.9751478", "1.6073049", "-0.7943208", "-1.6769376", "0.1249858", "-1.1098745", "-0.76688117", "1.0615785", "0.7432903", "0.67306495", "-0.09714622", "-1.5010128", "-1.0385193", "-0.3371908", "0.37467486", "-0.66894346", "-1.1356493", "-0.25251484", "-0.318283", "-1.3430134", "-0.9427777", "-2.2236629", "0.9844312", "1.9554058", "0.99979246", "1.0840023", "0.3790394", "0.94547254", "1.0479628", "0.44670445", "0.0929506", "-0.3353042", "-0.6595544", "-0.7899424", "0.32111892"]}
