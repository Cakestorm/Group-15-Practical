{"title": "Article 182", "body": {"ops": [{"insert": "Objectives: Inflammatory response and cytokine activation are markedly stimulated in skeletal muscle during various conditions. Interleukin-6 (IL-6), a pro-inflammatory cytokine, has pleiotropic effects on skeletal muscle. Adenosine, released by all cell types, binds to a class of G protein-coupled receptors to induce various skeletal muscle effects. The aim of this work was to investigate whether activation of adenosine receptors, particularly adenosine A2B receptors, could stimulate IL-6 gene expression in rat L6 skeletal muscle cells. Materials and Methods: The rat L6 skeletal muscle cells were cultured in 25 cm2 flasks. These differentiated cells were treated and then quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (Probe-based) was used to analyze IL-6 gene expression level among different treatment conditions. Results: Adenosine-5'-N-ethyluronamide (NECA), a stable adenosine analogue, concentration-and time-dependently stimulates IL-6 gene expression in skeletal muscle cells. The effect of NECA is inhibited by a selective adenosine A2B receptor antagonist, PSB 603. By using cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-arising reagent forskolin, cAMP is found to be involved in the up-regulation of IL-6 induction. Conclusion: Here, a novel relationship between adenosine and IL-6 up-regulation has been demonstrated for the first time; IL-6 up-regulation induced by NECA is mediated by adenosine A2B receptor activation in skeletal muscle and is dependent on mainly a cAMP pathway. Adenosine A2B receptors are, thus, potentially important pharmacological targets in treating inflammation and related diseases in skeletal muscle tissues.\n"}]}, "text": "Objectives: Inflammatory response and cytokine activation are markedly stimulated in skeletal muscle during various conditions.
