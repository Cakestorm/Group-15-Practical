Accurate and effective prediction of the lifetime or reliability of LED lighting has emerged as one of the key issues in the solid-state lighting field.

Prognostics bring benefits to both LED developers and users, such as optimizing system design, shortening qualification test times, enabling condition-based maintenance for LED-based systems, and providing information for return-on-investment analysis. This paper provides an overview of the prognostic methods and models that have been applied to both LED devices and LED systems, especially for use in long-term operational conditions. These methods include statistical regression, static Bayesian network, Kalman filtering, particle filtering, artificial neural network, and physics-based methods.
