We scrutinise young people's specific reasoning related to the social and psychological factors and contingent life events that influence their choice to withdraw. An experience of inadequacy, a feeling of failure and a lack of self-efficacy are common experiences in the data. This indicates that young adults who identify with the hikikomori phenomenon find external society demanding and consider themselves lacking resources such as education, social networks or the personality type that they see as valued in society and as essential to survival'. They also feel that they cannot control their life events, which may mean that they receive little help in their everyday lives.\n"}]}, "text": "This article explores socially withdrawn young Finnish people on an Internet forum who identify with the Japanese hikikomori phenomenon.
