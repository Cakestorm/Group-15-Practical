{"body": "MicroRNA (miRNA) is a highly conserved class of small noncoding RNA about 19-24 nucleotides in length that function in a specific manner to post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression in organisms. Tissue miRNA expression studies have discovered a myriad of functions for miRNAs in various aspects, but a role for miRNAs in chicken ovarian tissue at 300 days of age has not hitherto been reported. In this study, we performed the first miRNA analysis of ovarian tissues in chickens with low and high rates of egg production using high-throughput sequencing. By comparing low rate of egg production chickens with high rate of egg production chickens, 17 significantly differentially expressed miRNAs were found (P < 0.05), including 11 known and six novel miRNAs. We found that all 11 known miRNAs were involved mainly in pathways of reproduction regulation, such as steroid hormone biosynthesis and dopaminergic synapse. Additionally, expression profiling of six randomly selected differentially regulated miRNAs were validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Some miRNAs, such as gga-miR-34b, gga-miR-34c and gga-miR-216b, were reported to regulate processes such as proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis and metastasis and were expressed differentially in ovaries of chickens with high rates of egg production, suggesting that these miRNAs have an important role in ovary development and reproductive management of chicken. Furthermore, we uncovered that a significantly up-regulated miRNA-gga-miR-200a-3p- is ubiquitous in reproductionregulation- related pathways. This miRNA may play a special central role in the reproductive management of chicken, and needs to be further studied for confirmation.\n", "embeddings": ["-0.050130382", "1.399536", "-2.3761566", "0.35655543", "0.7291423", "0.10715571", "0.30862352", "1.4906029", "0.20461942", "0.7195872", "-0.89123124", "0.5865105", "-0.24077472", "0.158637", "-1.827323", "0.2753436", "-0.21722077", "-0.38082355", "-0.6210786", "-1.3493367", "0.24972925", "-0.72952867", "0.1592565", "0.45506546", "0.9807441", "-0.81937253", "0.9200337", "-0.13421114", "-0.338465", "-0.5880327", "0.13868871", "-0.1375048", "-0.62631714", "-0.80523324", "-0.3031297", "-1.5717831", "0.9855191", "-1.8385366", "1.1759953", "-0.58431524", "-1.612104", "-1.6923438", "-0.81966656", "-2.2385795", "0.2951366", "0.27681103", "-0.34939253", "0.7424673", "0.4693848", "-0.3004871", "-0.3389325", "0.44078448", "-0.631798", "0.6591714", "-0.7567775", "0.7942924", "0.121566586", "-0.11297803", "-0.39564496", "0.36801776", "-0.29931468", "0.42746243", "0.8450552", "0.5575533", "0.8947684", "0.7471986", "0.36976233", "2.355896", "-0.1373908", "-0.5610695", "0.33641014", "-0.99723953", "0.44383734", "0.5743997", "-0.25644085", "0.120093085", "2.206835", "-1.3502148", "-2.567537", "1.1077927", "-0.75859624", "-0.94199526", "0.34164882", "0.65658075", "0.12330601", "-0.34562242", "0.582679", "0.060526952", "-0.29701504", "-1.4518565", "-0.1488827", "-0.18280366", "0.3771665", "-0.29532352", "0.69673413", "-0.528976", "-0.10974817", "-0.87611926", "0.2611785", "-0.34695175", "0.053025506", "0.46125767", "0.49995407", "-0.53995717", "-0.10880476", "-0.46470696", "0.5796402", "-0.7125431", "-0.3114705", "-1.0479122", "-1.5468336", "-1.4640286", "1.0714366", "-2.1027515", "-0.10124787", "0.18706954", "1.4003958", "0.06316459", "-0.076404184", "-0.10537855", "1.4830813", "0.5451975", "-0.6516629", "-0.12565795", "1.9682527", "0.7045187", "0.9752177", "-1.8435743", "-0.06398792", "0.7230677", "1.2804393", "-0.17937355", "0.63260555", "0.7629984", "1.0034488", "0.18412904", "-0.42026886", "-2.100711", "0.77231115", "0.4753594", "2.263164", "-1.3718896", "0.13103524", "-0.21534632", "1.1920985", "-1.690285", "-0.3088677", "-0.31246474", "-0.17830585", "2.0242808", "0.66046876", "-0.38065448", "0.11566982", "-0.061225682", "-0.3568055", "-0.30691582", "1.124246", "0.201919", "0.6833402", "2.0040019", "0.36715406", "-0.39387533", "0.14720395", "0.2747567", "1.5992686", "1.042999", "0.23185807", "0.4357858", "-1.2450026", "0.21041484", "-0.89360774", "-0.6555354", "0.9334933", "0.77340156", "1.2528951", "-0.3333959", "0.89313227", "-1.2632055", "0.5000334", "-0.88365203", "0.030526465", "0.32118288", "-0.26913688", "-0.46665007", "-0.22231585", "0.12985852", "1.0033971", "0.037908923", "0.56765866", "-1.102629", "1.2156734", "1.2464496", "-1.1514517", "-2.1100247", "1.8492012", "0.41991368", "-0.24484746", "0.2585159", "-0.7697577", "-1.593697"]}
