{"title": "Article 2476", "body": "Development of effective monitoring systems of power exchange fluctuations and proportional alignment of loading on gas-diesel-generator units requires carrying out detailed researches both their own fluctuations, and exchange fluctuations in case of parallel work of several units. Carrying out such researches on real objects is limited to their considerable cost and can be given only at the final stage. Therefore it is very important for developers to have adequate models of the studied objects. The researches of output voltage frequency fluctuations for real objects executed by authors showed that in general they have casual character, and these fluctuations in all range of loadings represent non-stationary casual process with the changing population mean and dispersion. Authors developed mathematical model of the regulator stabilizing exchange fluctuations of power in the studied system. But there was a question of its hardware realization because it requires solving the problem of identification of the structure of this system and on-line monitoring of changes in its parameters and signals. The authors have proposed a candidate solution for such a problem through the example of identification and synthesis of the system of measuring system performance indicators required to appraise the electric power quality in this system and, as consequence, performance quality.\n", "text": "Development of effective monitoring systems of power exchange fluctuations and proportional alignment of loading on gas-diesel-generator units requires carrying out detailed researches both their own fluctuations, and exchange fluctuations in case of parallel work of several units.
