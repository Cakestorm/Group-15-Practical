{"title": "Article 2382", "body": {"ops": [{"insert": "Digitally controlled oscillators are the main cores in all-digital phase-locked loops (ADPLL), which are important for determining the range of frequency and power consumption in ADPLLs. In the conventional digitally controlled oscillator (DCO) designs, one single band of operation is assigned to the DCO. The following paper presents a new approach in the design of DCOs, which works in dual-band and wide-band modes with a control unit. In dual-band mode, the DCO works in two different ranges of frequencies simultaneously via digital control bits. The wide-band DCO (WBDCO) works in one wider range of frequencies consecutively. It seems that in the wide-band DCO, the gap width for the dual-band DCO (DBDCO) is zero. The previously mentioned designs allow the designer to have standard frequencies with the help of direct or multiplied frequencies. So, we can have a trade-off between power and performance.
