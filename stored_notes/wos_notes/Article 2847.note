{"title": "Article 2847", "body": "Background: Aloe vera (A. v) have been used traditionally for topical treatment of wounds and burns in different countries for centuries, but the mechanism of this effect is not well understood. Various growth factors are implicated in the process of wound healing. Among the different growth factors involved in the process, TGF beta 1 and bFGF are the most importantly expressed in fibroblast cells. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of A. v on the expression of angiogenesis growth factors in mouse embryonic fibroblast cells. Methods: We exposed mouse embryonic fibroblast cells to different concentrations of A. v (50, 100 and 150 mu g/ml) at two different time of 12 and 24 h. Fibroblast cell without A. v treatment serves as the control. The expression of TGF beta 1 and bFGF was measured by real time-polymerase chain reaction (real-time-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) at the level of gene and protein. Results: We observed that A.v gel at first up-regulated the expression of TGF beta 1 and bFGF, but, these genes were later repressed after a particular time. Conclusion: Our results demonstrated that A. v was dose-dependent and time-dependent on the expression of bFGF and TGFb1 in fibroblast cell in vitro. This mechanism can be employed in the prospective treatment of physical lesion. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.
