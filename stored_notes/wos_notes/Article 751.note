{"title": "Article 751", "body": "Background Cognitive differences, including deficits in self-awareness, are common in high-functioning individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and represent a fruitful target for intervention. The current project presents the preliminary research undertaken in the development of metacognitive training (MCT), an intervention designed to increase knowledge about personal strengths and challenges in adolescents with ASD.Method Two groups of 4 adolescents with ASD completed MCT, as well as measures to assess satisfaction and adverse effects. Visual inspection and thematic analysis were used to interpret the data.Results Overall, both participants and their parents rated MCT favourably; the youth most enjoyed the interactive activities, whereas parents appreciated the opportunity for socialising and psychoeducation. There were no systematic changes on quantitative measures of adverse effects (i.e. self-esteem or depression).Conclusion Although the results suggest further investigation of MCT may be warranted, certain modifications to the MCT protocol and research methodology are needed.\n", "text": "Background Cognitive differences, including deficits in self-awareness, are common in high-functioning individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and represent a fruitful target for intervention.
