In this work, AZO films have been deposited on glass substrate by radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering.

Morphological and electrical measurements have revealed that the substrate temperatures have strong influence on the microstructure, optical and electrical properties of AZO films. The AZO film is highly transparent from ultraviolet up to near infrared range with highest average transparency exceeding 83%. The minimum resistivity is as low as 6.1 x 10(-4) Omega cm.
