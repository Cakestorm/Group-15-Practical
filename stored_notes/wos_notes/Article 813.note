{"title": "Article 813", "body": "Aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO) has attained intensive attention as being a very good transparent conducting oxide for photovoltaic applications. In this work, AZO films have been deposited on glass substrate by radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering. The influences of substrate temperatures on morphological, structural, optical and electrical properties of AZO films were systematically investigated. The results indicate that all AZO films have the hexagonal structure with c-axis preferred orientation. Morphological and electrical measurements have revealed that the substrate temperatures have strong influence on the microstructure, optical and electrical properties of AZO films. The AZO film is highly transparent from ultraviolet up to near infrared range with highest average transparency exceeding 83%. The minimum resistivity is as low as 6.1 x 10(-4) Omega cm. The carrier concentration and mobility are as high as 3.357 x 10(20) cm(-3) and 30.48 cm(2)/Vs, respectively. Finally, the performances of the AZO film are evaluated by its practical application in Cu(ln(1-x)Ga(x))Se-2 (CIGS) photovoltaic device as a transparent electrode. Benefited from its highly transparent and conductive feature, the most efficient device reveals an efficiency of 7.8% with a short-circuit current density of 28.99 mA/cm(2), an open-circuit voltage of 430 mV, and a fill factor of 62.44 under standard conditions.
