The goal of the current pilot study was to investigate whether momentary stress and cortisol serve as mechanisms linking maltreatment history to gestational length. Methods: Seventeen women enrolled in the study (35% maltreated). Women completed two study sessions at 27 and 34 weeks gestation. Following each session, at four times/day over two days, women reported their momentary stress levels by text message and provided corresponding salivary cortisol samples. Gestational length was determined by medical chart review. Results: Higher reports of momentary stress were associated with shortened gestational length. High stress predicted lower cortisol concentrations for women with maltreatment histories but higher concentrations among women without maltreatment. Conclusion: Results from this pilot study provide preliminary evidence for understanding mechanisms explaining increased risk for preterm birth among childhood maltreatment victims.\n"}]}, "text": "Background: Pregnant victims of childhood maltreatment are more likely to deliver preterm.
