{"title": "Article 1942", "body": {"ops": [{"insert": "Green energy has gained significant research attention across the globe due to its ability to reduce environmental damage. However, for complete acceptance of green energy, only government regulations are not enough; the willingness to use green energy and contribute to the wellbeing of the environment should spring from within consumers. Such willingness may be developed by enhancing consumers' perceived value of green energy. However, in order to do so, it is necessary to assess existing levels of consumers' perceived value towards green energy. The present study develops a multidimensional green perceived value scale to measure existing levels of consumers' perceived value. The scale considers green perceived value as a multidimensional second order construct comprising functional value, social value, conditional value and emotional value dimensions. Such an attempt has not been made before which highlights the originality value of the present study. The scale can be used to assess consumers' perception towards green energy. Such information would help in formulating strategies that encourage consumers to voluntarily adopt green energy. The study also reveals that it is not only the financial aspects that lead consumers to decide on adoption of green energy; consumers are also driven by emotional and social considerations. Thus, policy makers could formulate pro-green energy programmes and mass messages that appeal to consumers' sense of responsibility to voluntarily adopt green energy without having to rely on financial incentives. Researchers could examine the considered dimensions of the scale further with respect to other constructs related to consumer behaviour. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
