{"body": "Introduction: C1q play an important role in clearance of immune complexes and apoptotic cell debris. Impaired clearance leads to exposure of C1 native antigen and development of anti-C1q antibody formation. Anti-C1q antibody is well studied in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). Significance of anti-C1q Ab in Indian SLE patients and their clinical manifestations is not clear. Aim: The aim of this study was to investigate associations between anti-C1q antibody and clinical as well as serological markers of SLE. Materials and Methods: Retrospective study of SLE patients fulfilling either American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 1990 or Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) 2012 classification criteria were recruited from inpatients and outpatients services of the Clinical immunology and Rheumatology Department, Christian Medical College at Vellore, India between March 2013 and January 2015. Anti-C1q antibody was assayed by ELISA (Demeditec Diagnostics GmbH, Germany). Logistic regression analysis was performed to find the association of anti-C1q antibodies with serological and clinical parameters in SLE including Lupus Nephritis (LN). Results: Sixty nine patients (54.76%) out of 126 SLE patients had LN. Anti-C1q levels were higher in patients with LN as compared to those without (p<0.05). Anti-C1q antibody was also significantly associated with positive C1q immunofluorescence staining in renal biopsy specimens (p<0.05). Overall, renal Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) {OR 1.35 (1.08-1.69)}, low C4 {OR 3.11 (1.04-9.26)} and mucocutaneous manifestation {OR 4.72 (1.38-16.05)} were independently associated with anti-C1q levels in serum. Conclusion: Renal SLEDAI, low C4 and mucocutaneous manifestations were independently associated with raised anti C1q antibody in SLE patients.\n", "embeddings": ["-0.096643254", "0.6478163", "-0.3158299", "-1.6838102", "0.869525", "-1.0423305", "-0.9596117", "1.0621845", "-2.1354716", "0.5344205", "-0.6695349", "-0.3058196", "0.48855415", "0.564635", "-0.5889132", "-2.329782", "-0.48975587", "0.449988", "0.7934108", "-2.219701", "-0.12988152", "-1.3753567", "1.2720743", "0.9359809", "-0.3292737", "-0.86347014", "1.1545407", "-1.0734301", "-0.8056057", "-0.45544901", "-0.22486074", "0.21691506", "1.6315886", "-1.1624017", "-0.15247479", "-0.11382741", "-0.20507655", "-1.544075", "-0.62618995", "0.32416064", "-1.4248495", "0.50736105", "-0.96106887", "-1.1450809", "1.0560881", "0.07294585", "1.1210401", "-0.87024546", "-1.293247", "-0.5644238", "0.47314683", "0.4733328", "0.32143527", "-0.1657135", "-0.42001045", "0.5389453", "-1.1784537", "0.28228688", "0.30261466", "1.0925171", "0.5254778", "0.18858168", "-0.20291413", "-0.2316918", "-0.7563714", "-0.32145125", "-0.34389102", "1.1051043", "-0.5246426", "1.5735849", "0.55330664", "1.6667317", "0.3234062", "0.5669034", "0.06002499", "2.9591415", "0.04874406", "-0.50570893", "-1.2406137", "-0.4497746", "-0.45146883", "-1.0488087", "-1.0103381", "1.4054917", "-0.49976653", "0.11521303", "-1.5811484", "0.08256758", "0.34338045", "0.006734504", "0.04882406", "-0.2671915", "1.181682", "0.104947105", "0.4496675", "-0.26262385", "0.6967702", "-0.55544794", "0.22653604", "-0.6022965", "0.47820318", "1.0620152", "0.51157784", "-0.50362307", "-0.7068787", "-3.737367", "0.47433528", "0.0906715", "-1.8725586", "-0.85062283", "-0.55600214", "0.8258891", "-0.045113858", "-0.4418572", "1.5670271", "-1.1950694", "-0.095931254", "-0.86265004", "-0.82982785", "-1.4378835", "0.94445497", "0.92449725", "0.3939348", "0.1952652", "-0.59744155", "-0.013840355", "0.089565605", "-0.0034472472", "0.4263641", "0.722075", "0.34996435", "-0.28325182", "-1.7755505", "-0.26181328", "1.0689505", "-0.75072736", "0.39729658", "-1.2459345", "-0.57181233", "-0.9317493", "-0.98806465", "0.9784319", "-0.18303983", "0.15245369", "-0.7628708", "-0.39394608", "-0.11567752", "1.3138403", "0.72588617", "-0.7144734", "-0.7662634", "-0.42995647", "-0.45619616", "-0.8779898", "-0.8921468", "1.1284285", "0.658849", "0.6472687", "-0.78460395", "-0.7063481", "-0.95156", "0.9265549", "0.7178539", "0.07979286", "-2.0407507", "1.2774845", "1.2755706", "-1.9373826", "-0.07845092", "-0.15020743", "-2.2450583", "0.09424361", "-0.57653546", "-0.073433824", "0.7578711", "0.2169527", "-0.78241247", "0.6044903", "1.8416944", "0.8918837", "-0.11065601", "0.15999909", "-0.72651863", "-0.5904442", "0.4119736", "-0.52810407", "-0.60982305", "0.6322229", "-0.5999124", "0.15682344", "-0.3430455", "-0.68920064", "0.17538197", "0.9186984", "1.68626", "0.13430904", "-1.0750513", "-1.2927201", "0.118088946", "-0.1352315"]}
