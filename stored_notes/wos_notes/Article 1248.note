{"title": "Article 1248", "body": {"ops": [{"insert": "An attributional life cycle assessment (LCA) was conducted to provide a comprehensive picture of the environmental burdens associated with cacao production and primary processing in the Philippines. The analysis considered the entire system, from agricultural operations in the field until storage of the dried beans, required to produce and process 1 ton of dried cacao beans. The inputs include fertilizer, pesticides, diesel, electricity and biodegradable plastics while the outputs include the dried beans, emissions of lambda-cyhalothrin, mancozeb, CO2, SO2, CH4, N2O, NO and CO, and solid wastes. The following impacts were found to be associated with the production of 1 ton dried cacao beans-0.163 kg 1,4-DB-eq. (human toxicity), 0.180 kg 1,4-DB-eq. (terrestrial ecotoxicity), 0.796 kg SO2 eq. (atmospheric acidification) and 629.93 kg CO2 eq. (climate change). Transportation, harvesting, pest management, and nutrient management contributed the most to the environmental impact categories considered in the study. As such, it is suggested that improvement measures be focused on the reduction of fossil fuel consumption and judicious application of fertilizers and pesticides to minimize the adverse environmental impacts of cacao production and primary processing. The amount of harmful emissions released and the impact scores of cacao production and primary processing are generally low. This may be an indication of the cleaner production and eco-efficiency of the system. The results of this LCA study serves as a feedback mechanism that will assist the Philippine cacao industry in identifying the options for improving the environmental management of its production and primary processing system.\n"}]}, "text": "An attributional life cycle assessment (LCA) was conducted to provide a comprehensive picture of the environmental burdens associated with cacao production and primary processing in the Philippines.
