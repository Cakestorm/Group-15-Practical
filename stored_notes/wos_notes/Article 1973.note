Here, we obtained a corneal endothelial cell line from normal rabbit corneal endothelium that had acquired infinite proliferative potential without requiring gene transfer.

Scanning electron microscopy showed that many microvilli were present on the surface of the cells and that the ultrastructure was maintained. In addition, we verified that the iRCECs had similar levels of pump function as did RCECs using an Ussing chamber system. The results of a soft agar colony-formation assay suggested that the iRCECs were not tumourigenic. Taken together, our results demonstrated that the iRCECs exhibited gene expression profiles and properties that were equivalent to those of native rabbit corneal endothelium, making these cells useful for corneal endothelial research studies.
