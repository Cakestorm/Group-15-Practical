{"title": "Article 1382", "body": "This study examined the effect of resistance exercise on the production, recruitment, percentage, and adhesion characteristics of granulocytes with andwithout polyphenol (PPB) supplementation. Thirty-eight untrained men were randomized into three groups: PPB (n=13, 21.8 +/- 2.5 years, 171.2 +/- 5.5cm, 71.2 +/- 8.2kg), placebo (PL; n=15, 21.6 +/- 2.5years, 176.5 +/- 4.9cm, 84.0 +/- 15.7kg), or control (CON; n=10, 23.3 +/- 4.3years, 173.7 +/- 12.6cm, 77.3 +/- 16.3kg). Blood samples were obtained pre (PRE), immediately (IP), 1h (1H), 5h (5H), 24h (24H), 48h (48H), and 96h (96H) postresistance exercise (PPB/PL) or rest (CON). Fine-needle biopsies were obtained from the vastus lateralis at PRE, 1H, 5H, and 48H. Plasma concentrations and intramuscular content of interleukin-8 (IL-8), granulocyte (G-CSF), and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) were analyzed via multiplex assays. Changes in relative number of circulating granulocytes and adhesion receptor (CD11b) were assessed using flow cytometry. Intramuscular IL-8 was significantly elevated at 1H, 5H, and 48H (P<0.001). Area under the curve analysis indicated a greater intramuscular IL-8 content in PL than PPB (P=0.011). Across groups, circulating G-CSF was elevated from PRE at IP (P<0.001), 1H (P=0.011), and 5H (P=0.025), while GM-CSF was elevated at IP (P<0.001) and 1H (P=0.007). Relative number of granulocytes was elevated at 1H (P<0.001), 5H (P<0.001), and 24H (P=0.005, P=0.006) in PPB and PL, respectively. Across groups, granulocyte CD11b expression was upregulated from PRE to IP (P<0.001) and 1H (P=0.015). Results indicated an increase in circulating CD11b on granulocytes, and IL-8 within the muscle following intense resistance exercise. Polyphenol supplementation may attenuate the IL-8 response, however, did not affect granulocyte percentage and adhesion molecule expression in peripheral blood following resistance exercise.\n", "text": "This study examined the effect of resistance exercise on the production, recruitment, percentage, and adhesion characteristics of granulocytes with andwithout polyphenol (PPB) supplementation.
