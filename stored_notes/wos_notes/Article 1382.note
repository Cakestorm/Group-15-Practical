{"body": "This study examined the effect of resistance exercise on the production, recruitment, percentage, and adhesion characteristics of granulocytes with andwithout polyphenol (PPB) supplementation. Thirty-eight untrained men were randomized into three groups: PPB (n=13, 21.8 +/- 2.5 years, 171.2 +/- 5.5cm, 71.2 +/- 8.2kg), placebo (PL; n=15, 21.6 +/- 2.5years, 176.5 +/- 4.9cm, 84.0 +/- 15.7kg), or control (CON; n=10, 23.3 +/- 4.3years, 173.7 +/- 12.6cm, 77.3 +/- 16.3kg). Blood samples were obtained pre (PRE), immediately (IP), 1h (1H), 5h (5H), 24h (24H), 48h (48H), and 96h (96H) postresistance exercise (PPB/PL) or rest (CON). Fine-needle biopsies were obtained from the vastus lateralis at PRE, 1H, 5H, and 48H. Plasma concentrations and intramuscular content of interleukin-8 (IL-8), granulocyte (G-CSF), and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) were analyzed via multiplex assays. Changes in relative number of circulating granulocytes and adhesion receptor (CD11b) were assessed using flow cytometry. Intramuscular IL-8 was significantly elevated at 1H, 5H, and 48H (P<0.001). Area under the curve analysis indicated a greater intramuscular IL-8 content in PL than PPB (P=0.011). Across groups, circulating G-CSF was elevated from PRE at IP (P<0.001), 1H (P=0.011), and 5H (P=0.025), while GM-CSF was elevated at IP (P<0.001) and 1H (P=0.007). Relative number of granulocytes was elevated at 1H (P<0.001), 5H (P<0.001), and 24H (P=0.005, P=0.006) in PPB and PL, respectively. Across groups, granulocyte CD11b expression was upregulated from PRE to IP (P<0.001) and 1H (P=0.015). Results indicated an increase in circulating CD11b on granulocytes, and IL-8 within the muscle following intense resistance exercise. Polyphenol supplementation may attenuate the IL-8 response, however, did not affect granulocyte percentage and adhesion molecule expression in peripheral blood following resistance exercise.\n", "embeddings": ["0.27131218", "1.5734059", "-1.4265571", "-0.82028383", "1.2623857", "-0.26772696", "-0.5060513", "2.3191347", "-1.7400272", "-0.69546777", "-0.7202052", "-1.8156255", "-1.2932855", "-0.8110014", "0.36518764", "-0.5179572", "-0.105708346", "1.3792434", "-1.2106315", "-4.107271", "0.3736477", "-0.24272898", "0.0025543352", "-0.6075598", "-0.29047906", "-0.24500574", "1.7370551", "1.1205829", "-1.0489392", "0.3147296", "-0.110379465", "-0.15452282", "0.9979313", "-0.41244382", "-0.30960867", "1.3804674", "-1.3744261", "0.011909086", "0.34937862", "1.1753125", "0.97367775", "0.60856354", "0.009492426", "0.15968491", "0.017190048", "0.22945741", "1.3166137", "-0.032117646", "0.061997183", "0.2380631", "1.4545144", "-0.41713324", "0.056083657", "-1.5642157", "0.37459302", "0.63778394", "-1.9565481", "0.18201281", "-0.2741736", "-0.42889997", "0.37242997", "-0.18582153", "-0.0911373", "1.5203167", "1.5992641", "-0.29460162", "0.5532141", "-0.48114613", "-1.3172988", "-0.66797", "-0.98321265", "1.4739436", "0.5787341", "-0.5495326", "-0.2558065", "0.6859956", "0.6858162", "0.31452847", "-1.4412538", "-0.9344897", "-0.16582817", "-1.4089448", "-1.0556377", "2.0705216", "-1.022218", "0.11261065", "-1.5890563", "-1.3742223", "-0.12001209", "-0.3714457", "0.5318781", "1.2128015", "0.29545978", "0.48374403", "1.0862044", "-1.045681", "0.96734446", "-0.6289604", "0.26676714", "0.44506186", "-1.9549553", "0.032091036", "0.69195205", "-1.3715918", "-4.182162", "-1.5412887", "0.89371467", "3.7884645", "0.17571567", "-1.8253883", "1.183164", "-1.2693967", "0.9649623", "1.2790961", "0.28161886", "-0.4214153", "0.8669162", "-0.6094893", "0.025178151", "-0.62094563", "-1.402638", "-0.61416453", "0.73657185", "0.0054147695", "1.547449", "0.7369455", "0.0016365495", "-1.3007389", "1.0816665", "0.14057587", "0.37178102", "-0.40772587", "-2.286154", "-1.2636898", "-0.015554902", "-0.728523", "-1.5680301", "0.117593765", "-0.70504904", "-0.7893092", "-0.2529291", "0.9752575", "-0.086533085", "-1.0681543", "-1.5078387", "0.7271233", "0.013315855", "-0.88084614", "-1.1434169", "1.9098601", "0.29724842", "1.6316309", "-0.67534506", "-0.6592998", "-1.6390364", "-0.44699398", "1.9767807", "-1.1156671", "-0.9569259", "0.2939248", "1.2029809", "1.0108584", "0.32566458", "0.9888352", "0.96416396", "-0.33196005", "1.534669", "-1.661069", "-0.61810017", "0.8940049", "-0.5473433", "0.46735904", "0.81106824", "0.4197299", "2.0242374", "-1.1223223", "-2.352531", "1.614264", "0.8940571", "-0.56257445", "0.39312458", "-0.6091715", "1.3091623", "0.7267277", "0.048849236", "0.153745", "-0.6610557", "0.40743238", "-0.04508742", "0.0070432522", "1.1951582", "0.77325666", "1.029288", "-0.9503353", "0.35122976", "1.3453285", "0.8484476", "-0.7417818", "0.8042345", "-1.1516517"]}
