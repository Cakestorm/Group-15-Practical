{"body": "The long-term effect of feeding the catecholamine analog ractopamine (RAC; ractopamine hydrochloride, Elanco Animal Health, Indianapolis, IN) on the expression of genes involved in energy and lipid metabolism in subcutaneous adipose tissue was studied. Large White pigs (84 kg) were fed corn- and soybean meal-based diets supplemented with 0, 20, or 60 mg/kg of RAC for 14, 28, or 42 d. Expression (mRNA abundance) in adipose tissue of sterol regulatory binding protein-1 (SREBP-1), PPAR alpha, PPAR gamma 2, fatty acid synthase (FAS), glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4), and stearoyl-CoA desaturase was determined by Northern blotting. Feed intakes did not differ, and RAC (20 and 60 mg/kg) improved BW gain at d 14, 28, and 42 (P < 0.05) and increased loin eye area (measured on d 42 only; P < 0.05). Expression of SREBP-1 and PPAR gamma 2 declined (P < 0.05) with RAC by d 28 and 42, whereas expression of PPAR alpha was increased (P < 0.05) on d 14, 28, and 42. After 14 d, expression of FAS and GLUT4 was decreased (P < 0.05) with 60 mg/kg of RAC, whereas both RAC concentrations attenuated FAS expression on d 28 and 42. Overall, adipose tissue stearoyl-CoA desaturase expression was not affected by RAC but showed somewhat less expression (P < 0.15) on d 28 at 60 mg/kg of RAC. Although prolonged, chronic RAC feeding most likely downregulates adipose tissue membrane beta-adrenergic receptors, mRNA abundances of anabolic lipid metabolism transcription factors, glucose transporters, and enzymes (SREBP-1, PPAR gamma 2, FAS, GLUT4) were still attenuated up to d 42. Conversely, a transcription factor related to oxidative metabolism expression (PPAR alpha) was enhanced. We conclude that even after 42 d, RAC still decreased expression of lipogenic genes in adipose tissue by yet undefined cyclic adenosine monophosphate-directed mechanisms, but in contemporary lean pigs, this effect is likely of limited practical significance.\n", "embeddings": ["-0.7665438", "0.9082136", "-1.200845", "-1.3099989", "1.1559389", "-0.81845385", "0.1917027", "1.8160235", "-0.89075875", "-0.29793406", "-0.18115833", "-1.2177774", "0.91566056", "0.35045552", "-0.89252", "-1.1138401", "0.3156814", "0.5112136", "0.24093252", "-0.55582786", "0.5030455", "0.25467783", "-0.24643262", "0.17572604", "1.2863176", "-0.2698072", "1.4041711", "0.8844192", "-2.5779235", "0.25790504", "0.6673242", "-0.048317622", "-0.60530496", "-1.4865638", "0.14903696", "0.81035703", "0.22290613", "-2.0446384", "0.73676413", "0.8334811", "-0.0041883984", "1.9464537", "-0.72962445", "-0.81892055", "2.0415938", "-0.28588632", "0.09944172", "1.0289948", "1.1641294", "-0.5707958", "0.6946297", "1.6321012", "-0.18450274", "1.5993161", "0.27763623", "0.13781056", "-1.5426321", "-1.89203", "-0.11400383", "1.6908097", "-1.2077547", "-2.6595817", "2.684813", "1.0995672", "0.5274286", "0.5502848", "2.629132", "1.37245", "-1.4274944", "0.5585161", "-0.32081354", "-1.2922423", "-0.4821228", "-1.6032687", "-1.94304", "1.7197747", "1.8194134", "-0.9540984", "-0.60728294", "0.36282465", "1.2389575", "-1.745878", "-2.038221", "0.89235157", "0.9553606", "-0.26627186", "0.8685671", "0.40179792", "-0.36418033", "-0.39584804", "1.9188327", "1.2330297", "0.08784518", "0.45741922", "-0.36344817", "-0.22344308", "-1.0112853", "-0.70286876", "0.60158986", "0.5537233", "0.32517472", "0.16472536", "1.3922515", "-1.9745044", "-2.8789382", "-0.75219154", "0.5685378", "0.39363524", "-0.68206096", "-1.5321231", "0.15727371", "-1.2035342", "-0.5219818", "0.18404318", "1.2725905", "-0.38415152", "0.56304604", "-0.7251169", "-1.2574412", "-0.46324694", "-0.98212993", "1.476715", "-0.16496433", "0.090337686", "1.2543657", "-0.2087321", "0.7903681", "-1.8201563", "0.020244885", "-0.27160162", "0.20449488", "0.318505", "0.25938353", "0.333397", "1.5079277", "0.5377766", "-0.043119207", "-1.2494924", "-1.5513707", "-1.207885", "0.44023353", "-0.1122618", "-1.859131", "0.6924753", "-0.30023488", "1.4060824", "0.22657523", "-0.66889024", "0.4172435", "1.1039624", "-0.07648515", "-0.11978877", "-0.83126837", "1.8105181", "-1.4092338", "0.72213626", "-0.019196937", "-0.7621734", "0.5426842", "-1.6698", "0.2664252", "0.0871805", "0.023339547", "-1.2348505", "-1.1386107", "0.09645121", "-0.6170262", "1.2325572", "0.41163978", "-0.80073744", "-1.2380956", "1.0263765", "-0.23976202", "0.6955901", "0.7238704", "-0.54461133", "0.115037836", "-0.5465976", "0.8818631", "-0.69037575", "-0.17677212", "-1.9220002", "-0.335465", "-1.2327274", "0.14183055", "1.9699564", "-0.45401737", "0.59322464", "1.6021465", "0.38048667", "0.69903815", "0.307057", "-0.6630451", "-0.411112", "-0.43495595", "1.1085621", "-0.5722263", "0.88276386", "0.09233538", "-0.04765389"]}
