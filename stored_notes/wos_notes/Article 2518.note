{"title": "Article 2518", "body": {"ops": [{"insert": "Objective: Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-axis is involved in human oncogenesis and metastasis development for various solid tumors including breast cancer. Aim of this study was to assess the association between IGF-1, IGFbinding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) serum levels and the presence of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in the peripheral blood of women diagnosed with early breast cancer (EBC), before and after adjuvant chemotherapy. Design: 171 patients with early-stage breast adenocarcinomas were retrospectively evaluated. Immunoradiometric (IRMA) assays were employed for the in-vitro determination of IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 serum levels in blood samples collected after surgical treatment and before initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy. CTCs' presence was assessed through detection of cytokeratin-19 (CK-19) mRNA transcripts using quantitative real timereverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). IGF-1, IGFBP-3 serum levels were correlated with CFCs' presence before and after adjuvant chemotherapy as well as with tumor characteristics including tumor size, axillary lymph node status, oestrogen (ER)/progestorene (PR) and human epidermural growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) receptor status. Log-rank test was applied to investigate possible association between IGF-1, IGFBP-3 serum levels and disease-free interval (DFI) and overall survival (OS). Results: Before initiation of adjuvant therapy IGF-1, IGFBP-3 serum levels were moderately associated (Spearman's rho = 0361, p < 0.001) with each other, while presenting significant differences across age groups (all p values < 0.05). IGF-1 serum levels did not correlate with the presence of CTCs before initiation (p = 0.558) or after completion (p = 0.474) of adjuvant chemotherapy. Similarly, IGFBP-3 serum levels did not show significant association with detectable CTCs either before (p = 0.487) or after (p = 0.134) completion of adjuvant chemotherapy. There was no statistically significant association between the clinical outcome of patients in terms of DFI, OS and IGF-1(DFI: p = 0.499; OS: p = 0.220) or IGFBP-3 (DFI: p = 0.900; OS: p = 0.406) serum levels. Conclusions: IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 serum levels before initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy are not indicative of CTCs' presence in the blood and do not correlate with clinical outcome of women with early-stage breast cancer.
