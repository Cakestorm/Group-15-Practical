Without accumulation in any energy storage unit, the electricity generated by the nanofiber device is sufficient to light up tens of commercial LEDs, run electrochemical reactions and protect metals from corrosion. Such a novel acoustoelectric generator may offer an effective solution to recycling noise pollution into usable electricity.\n"}]}, "text": "Conversion of mechanical forces, vibrations and sound which have energy in the range of milli- to tens of watts (also referred to as \"small kinetic energies\" in this paper) into electricity has received global attention owing to the potential in powering electronic devices.
