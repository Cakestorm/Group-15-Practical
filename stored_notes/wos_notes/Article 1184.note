{"body": "Breast cancer is a disease of unknown etiology; however, the major risk factors are genetic alterations. Studies have demonstrated an association between insulinlike growth factor 1 (IGF-1) gene polymorphism and cell proliferation and reduced apoptosis, in addition to its role in breast cancer growth and aggressiveness. Two polymorphic variants of the IGF-1 gene are highlighted in association with breast cancer, rs6220 and rs7136446, although controversy exists as to this relationship. The current study included 137 women (68 breast cancer cases and 69 controls without breast cancer) who had 3 ml of peripheral blood drawn for the study of genomic DNA extracted from leukocytes using the genotyping technique by real-time polymerase chain reaction. The CC genotype (rs7136446) was present in 4 women (5.9%) from the case group and in 2 (3.0%) women from the control group (p = 0.67), while the GG genotype (rs6220) occurred in 8 (11.5%) women from the case group and in 5 (7.2%) women from the control group (p = 0.75). No statistically significant difference was observed between the CC genotype of variant rs7136446 in premenopausal case and control women (p = 0.31), thus as there was also no significant difference between case and control postmenopausal women (p = 1.00). Concerning the GG genotype of rs6220, it occurred in 6 (14.2%) premenopausal case and 4 (8%) control women (p = 0.71) and no difference was found in postmenopausal women (p = 1.00). In the current study, IGF-1 gene polymorphism of SNP variants rs6220 and rs7136446 had no statistically significant association with breast cancer, both in premenopausal and postmenopausal women.\n", "embeddings": ["0.96852386", "-1.7682797", "-0.47323677", "-0.02963584", "0.21936528", "0.02072518", "0.8120121", "1.9118633", "-0.64036334", "-1.490975", "0.3086171", "-1.1105807", "0.7545031", "-0.1633916", "-0.5462194", "0.89141154", "0.39123183", "-0.24708843", "0.15687564", "-1.6607592", "-0.41030714", "-0.7766928", "-1.1635485", "-0.28810123", "-0.052128688", "-1.6562915", "-0.5752037", "0.67443496", "-0.5113871", "0.76016337", "1.0184245", "0.9218375", "-1.02397", "-0.3163397", "1.2020439", "0.42321566", "-0.05012264", "-0.3702108", "-0.6344345", "-1.3339723", "-0.3066166", "0.64633846", "-1.0221598", "-0.83000684", "0.38593087", "-0.17991391", "-0.96745795", "-0.14331768", "-0.9896316", "-0.042077325", "0.5944317", "0.84977925", "-1.1381426", "-0.67465407", "1.2261564", "-0.020312157", "-0.4567663", "-1.3101952", "0.04877192", "0.6087106", "0.106514305", "1.657609", "1.2515888", "0.25732413", "-0.67124104", "1.6188344", "-0.888204", "1.7083048", "0.17508964", "0.7136435", "-0.50314426", "0.7665069", "0.05889564", "0.44115698", "0.22504757", "0.6619171", "-0.05238013", "-0.38049248", "-0.90248716", "-0.33613664", "-0.34073302", "-0.82668185", "-1.9195958", "0.39603236", "-1.1417414", "-0.6316963", "0.19125283", "1.0314784", "-0.65960383", "0.9034093", "1.1338586", "1.5268648", "0.14296402", "0.91096264", "0.22787185", "-0.39794305", "-0.59263784", "-0.5381379", "-0.102378584", "-0.04624229", "1.5695895", "0.7708572", "1.1147429", "-0.75097114", "-0.26857945", "0.8188811", "-0.20542741", "1.0512891", "-0.3579567", "-1.2504687", "-0.7710202", "0.09514768", "0.6454686", "-0.78459084", "0.15155454", "-1.5996766", "-1.2525142", "0.23374605", "-0.27706414", "0.15455526", "0.3428053", "0.14283375", "0.54425025", "-1.7149795", "-0.99158853", "-0.5024707", "0.56496435", "-0.23227435", "-1.1683403", "0.24773815", "1.888038", "1.132155", "0.20529634", "-0.4607543", "-1.6827198", "1.9151248", "-0.20780312", "1.0723891", "-1.4338955", "-0.1417129", "0.16300012", "-1.4676679", "0.6167216", "-0.9699935", "-0.25392923", "0.7959304", "0.59913796", "0.34458524", "-0.58364874", "-0.1710402", "0.27875388", "-0.55395377", "-1.4405695", "-0.43983093", "-1.044759", "1.1108505", "-0.38936624", "1.8516506", "-0.3387115", "-0.30870882", "0.21276245", "0.11313342", "1.4233813", "0.0019603637", "-0.9822384", "0.9657998", "0.42366478", "-1.4111925", "-0.56716144", "1.1371999", "-0.89779085", "-0.82987565", "0.25330365", "0.20429504", "1.927771", "-0.4880466", "0.83384633", "0.878842", "-0.6019405", "-0.040986244", "-0.0017111044", "1.804946", "0.22581448", "0.23057313", "0.83821076", "-0.37803775", "0.7907816", "1.1748621", "-0.081238516", "0.641351", "0.4997459", "-0.96031433", "-0.4531138", "-0.047301568", "0.2441119", "-0.8995386", "0.96628183", "-0.18952048", "-0.7017595", "-1.1268544"]}
