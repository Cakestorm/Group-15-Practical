If a difference creates between the actual and forecasted wind speeds and the power delivery contract is signed between the Generation Companies (GENCOs) and Distribution Companies (DISCOs) as per the forecasted speed, then the GENCOs may be awarded or penalized by the Independent System Operator (ISO) for their surplus or deficit power supply.
