{"title": "Article 1210", "body": "Careful examination of the skin and soft tissues is a routine part of the forensic autopsy to identify and characterise traumatic lesions. Three cases are reported where benign vascular lesions presented as bruises. In case 1, a 44-year-old man with a history of epilepsy was found dead on the floor. Dissection of the neck revealed a haemorrhagic area 15mmx1.5mm, deep to the left thyrohyoid muscle. In case 2, an 87-year-old man was found dead with a plastic bag over his head attached to an opened cylinder of nitrogen gas. On the mucosal surface of his upper lip, there was an apparent 5mm blue/purple bruise. In case 3, examination of the back of a 16-month-old girl revealed an apparent 15mm bruise. Histological examination of all three lesions revealed benign vascular lesions. In the absence of microscopy, these lesions would have been considered traumatic in origin, raising the possibility of inflicted trauma.\n", "text": "Careful examination of the skin and soft tissues is a routine part of the forensic autopsy to identify and characterise traumatic lesions.
