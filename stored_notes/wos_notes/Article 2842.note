We have performed a microarray screening of genes regulated by FGF2 using primary cortical neuron culture derived from embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5) mouse forebrains. In this study, we have analysed a previously uncharacterised gene encoding a 180-amino acid protein, hereby named 'coiled-coil protein 1 (ccp1)', that showed a modest up-regulation upon FGF2 stimulation. Northern blots and RT-PCR showed specific expression of ccp1 in multiple tissues including adult and embryonic brains. In situ hybridizations revealed that ccpl was expressed in the cortical plate between Reelin and Tbr1-positive layers in the dorsal cortex at E15.5. Furthermore, the expression pattern of ccp1 at E13.5-E14.5 reflected some of the aspects of tangential migration of cortical progenitors during the early phase. We observed that the expressed ccpl protein was localised to endo/lysosomal compartment in the cell body as well as to vesicles present in the processes of primary cortical neurons and oligodendrocyte cell line.
