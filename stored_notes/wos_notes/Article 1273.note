While a great number of macrophages exist in lymph nodes, recent studies using animal models have shown that lymph node sinus macrophages are associated with the induction of anti-tumor immunity, playing a significant role in host immune responses against tumor cells. In colorectal tumor, malignant melanoma, and endometrial tumor, it was shown that a high density of CD169-positive macrophages in the LN sinus was a predictive factor for better clinical prognosis. The observations that the density of CD169-positive macrophages in the LN sinus was positively associated with the density of infiltrating T or NK cells in tumor tissues, indicates the significance of CD169-positive macrophages in anti-tumor immune reactions of tumor patients.
