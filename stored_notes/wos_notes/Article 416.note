{"title": "Article 416", "body": "Promethins have been shown to be present in the vertebrates examined so far, yet little is known to date about them in invertebrates. Here we isolated a cDNA encoding a promethin-like homolog from the gut cDNA library of the amphioxus Branchiostoma belcheri, a cephalochordate occupying a nodal position transient from invertebrates to vertebrates. It contained a 504 bp open reading frame corresponding to a protein of 167 amino acids. Primary structural examination showed that the deduced promethin-like homolog was a transmembrane protein with three potential transmembrane helices, resembling the vertebrate promethins. Phylogenetic analysis showed that B. belcheri promethin-like homolog was located at the base of the vertebrate counterparts, suggesting that it represents the archetype of vertebrate promethins. Both Northern blotting and in situ hybridization histochemistry revealed a tissue-specific expression pattern of promethin-like gene, like that of mammalian promethins. This is the first report on invertebrate promethin-like homolog, paving the way for further insights into the evolution and function of promethins.\n", "text": "Promethins have been shown to be present in the vertebrates examined so far, yet little is known to date about them in invertebrates.
