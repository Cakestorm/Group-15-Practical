{"body": "Purpose: The study aimed to investigate the effects of chronic moderate exercise on regulation of intracellular calcium signaling as an important link to proliferation capacity in murine splenic T lymphocytes. Methods: Male CD1 Swiss mice were randomly assigned either to a control group (CG) or an exercise training group (EG). EG mice performed voluntary exercise for 3 months. Lymphocytes were isolated from murine spleens and intracellular calcium was determined by using Fura-2(AM) and fluorescence spectrometry. The combination of flow cytometry and carboxy-fluorescein succinimidyl ester labeling technique was used for determination of cell proliferation. The expression levels of Ca2+-regulating genes were determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis. Results: Basal [Ca2+](i) was significantly higher in mice from the EG compared with mice of the CG (P < 0.001, n = 6). Similarly, [Ca2+](i) transients after stimulation with phytohemagglutinin, concanavalin A, and the anti-CD3 antibody induced were significantly increased in mice from the EG (P < 0.05, n = 5). However, no differences were found after stimulation with thapsigargin (P < 0.05, n = 5). CD3+ T cells from EG showed higher mitogen-induced proliferation levels than from CG (P < 0.05/0.01, n = 5). The mRNA expression of cellular Ca2+-regulating genes, such as STIM1, Cav2.3, TRPV4, IP3R2, ORAI1, MCU, TRPM5, and TRPC1, were significantly downregulated (P < 0.05/0.01, n = 5). Conclusion: This study suggests that chronic moderate exercise improves intracellular Ca2+ signaling in murine splenic lymphocytes. The enhanced availability of the second messenger Ca2+ is followed by an improved cellular function such as cell proliferation. The downregulation of Ca2+ homeostasis-related factor expression might be considered as a self-protective mechanism against elevated intracellular Ca2+ signals.\n", "embeddings": ["-0.2941652", "0.77590996", "-1.0066124", "0.87764853", "1.875984", "-0.2806276", "-0.5940325", "2.2672088", "0.63585985", "0.75610226", "-1.9400426", "-1.1100082", "0.07867828", "2.362938", "0.32006863", "0.47834286", "-0.43632767", "2.150001", "0.38040584", "-1.5942696", "0.26388267", "0.2737449", "-0.18306859", "-0.2557803", "0.019157032", "0.82182366", "1.3415123", "0.78560865", "-1.2553748", "0.1626867", "0.11413517", "-1.2769849", "-0.7099625", "-1.2160631", "-0.11485407", "1.3445462", "0.60422146", "0.7284307", "0.50551105", "-0.52384895", "0.95180976", "-0.40443686", "0.40016437", "0.31615412", "-0.07564086", "0.0487675", "-0.015986266", "0.7343658", "-0.10776167", "-0.041558873", "1.7967998", "-0.9238778", "1.262044", "-0.65819085", "0.5434885", "-0.07469289", "-1.6810913", "-1.2052495", "-0.8638199", "0.6741494", "-0.4103464", "0.38608366", "0.9673713", "0.19647011", "0.95331097", "0.7533265", "0.42573878", "0.43468758", "0.85132253", "-0.8006595", "1.2153422", "2.0642765", "-2.0500753", "1.1686779", "-0.046512134", "0.77294666", "0.27299067", "-0.46998265", "-0.8525905", "0.5899922", "-0.19053079", "0.09698111", "-2.1032557", "1.3195555", "-0.94868904", "-1.2851856", "0.8602561", "-0.11795115", "0.4077824", "0.57902074", "1.1545546", "-0.038411856", "-0.1939957", "0.78791165", "1.0032041", "-1.1573436", "0.78258806", "0.5821519", "-0.92351013", "1.1512526", "-0.16669407", "-0.51745343", "0.7202947", "-0.06849324", "-1.349311", "-1.4707373", "0.37662235", "1.6955644", "-0.39601225", "0.19002838", "0.07421956", "-2.4025156", "-0.045211602", "0.0076322425", "0.9622131", "-1.5485091", "1.2030028", "-1.4570659", "-0.4250825", "-1.9025586", "-0.47172445", "0.606312", "1.0494828", "-0.4640283", "1.6811484", "0.8640986", "0.2348183", "-1.875419", "-0.70165396", "0.66655713", "-0.7522152", "-1.9885564", "-0.9874486", "-0.42987004", "-0.16650389", "-0.212449", "-0.786011", "1.7434399", "1.420188", "-1.5178225", "1.1139884", "-0.59887534", "0.21117707", "0.3072147", "-1.2433481", "0.79849434", "0.08151295", "-0.65041167", "0.02937116", "2.057318", "0.1021612", "0.042654466", "-0.37644744", "-0.5007809", "0.19633569", "1.2615483", "1.2461689", "0.77940595", "0.23542531", "2.071122", "0.69261575", "0.36748832", "-0.6608679", "0.014201032", "0.6189087", "-1.1875075", "0.75375146", "-0.0033338019", "-0.81699646", "0.66724956", "-0.7749277", "0.71574664", "0.9069618", "-0.66285133", "1.6707323", "-0.55763286", "0.01695177", "0.28729877", "-0.23007263", "0.15310465", "0.48317337", "-0.81437147", "-0.27216917", "-0.76067144", "0.11669646", "-0.9578441", "-0.83786327", "1.4794513", "0.108150125", "0.8054086", "0.38259366", "0.07351851", "-0.8159335", "0.65085655", "-0.54006207", "3.0932455", "-0.29217607", "-0.45669472", "-1.2097219", "-1.554007"]}
