{"body": "Angiotensin-1-converting enzyme (ACE) gene has established substantial attention in the recent years as a candidate gene for hypertension, cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes. The aim of the present study was to investigate the association of ACE (I/D) polymorphism with coronary artery disease (CAD) in a north Indian population. A total of 662 subjects (330 CAD patients and 332 healthy controls) were examined for association of ACE gene (I/D) polymorphism and environmental risk factors. The mean age of the CAD patients and control subjects was 60.53 +/- 8.6 years and 56.55 +/- 7.7 years, respectively (p = 0.000). Anthropometric and demographic data showed BMI values significantly higher among CAD patients and control subjects (26.98 +/- 4.9 vs 24.04 +/- 4.7, p = 0.000). We observed pronounced central obesity in both CAD patients and controls, even at the lowest BMI values (< 23 kg/m(2)). Dyslipidemia was highly prevalent in CAD patients compared to control subjects. Genotypic data showed significantly higher frequency of DD genotype in CAD patients than that of control subjects (40 vs 28.3 %). No significant difference was observed in the distribution of ID genotypes between CAD patients and control subjects. Logistic regression analysis of data demonstrate that DD genotype was associated with 1.8 fold increased risk of development of CAD in Asian Indians (OR 1.8; 95 % CI 1.22-2.66; p = 0.003). The frequency of D allele was significantly higher in CAD patients (p = 0.001). No significant difference was observed in the clinical and biochemical characteristics of CAD patients and controls when the data was stratified according to the genotypes of ACE gene. In conclusion, DD genotype of ACE gene may be associated with increased risk of CAD in Asian Indian population.\n", "embeddings": ["0.5833876", "-1.360974", "0.36362395", "-0.96710366", "0.4489905", "-0.25761533", "0.23946711", "1.417727", "-0.5487824", "-0.09769101", "0.035142902", "-1.3996092", "0.2980696", "-0.71153647", "0.6406416", "0.63938737", "1.5399286", "-0.3079142", "-0.8233974", "-3.3147693", "-1.0598035", "-1.433272", "-0.5659403", "0.07180445", "0.4593006", "0.12232871", "-0.15168451", "-0.55771476", "-1.0359122", "1.0142164", "-1.2680837", "-0.27293572", "-0.55343664", "0.013409406", "0.5444206", "-0.4458426", "-1.2059934", "-2.1507473", "0.579906", "0.096066326", "-0.25948387", "0.63864857", "-1.9866422", "-0.9462471", "0.037369102", "-0.401234", "0.4736999", "0.06661821", "-1.3858421", "-0.8097255", "0.32754642", "-1.6176482", "-1.4603941", "0.71881014", "0.5616211", "-0.93399304", "0.53366584", "0.692827", "1.5233402", "0.17933697", "-0.020421593", "-0.4021028", "0.660786", "-0.35079676", "-0.50178665", "0.65093523", "0.3229611", "1.3429803", "0.35570475", "0.6442171", "-1.2589662", "1.0062829", "0.69288504", "0.58400273", "0.7695075", "-0.12317087", "0.63705134", "-0.087207586", "-0.38422465", "-0.38719568", "-0.25321287", "-1.5364211", "-0.6153835", "0.8005452", "-0.8108486", "0.41886202", "-0.2824445", "0.08115596", "-0.2270582", "-1.1835698", "0.9001558", "0.81003815", "0.14008564", "0.8817913", "-0.054284275", "1.0818332", "-0.7159435", "-0.51209", "1.6144363", "-1.0411448", "1.4194101", "1.1241102", "1.1853762", "-0.13532655", "-1.7764418", "-1.0448371", "-0.29398742", "1.8805513", "-1.0929111", "-1.7068994", "-1.3284956", "-0.29100958", "0.30096275", "-1.2077814", "-0.71020883", "-1.3651739", "-0.40538946", "-0.98455656", "-0.3924162", "-0.25091818", "1.5203866", "-0.46335647", "0.5608624", "-1.1374145", "-1.7321117", "-0.43606046", "-0.36959407", "-1.6537158", "-0.20179881", "0.11618649", "2.2360232", "0.37728754", "-0.81119114", "-0.1418703", "-0.6517007", "0.5340932", "-0.5367932", "-0.508956", "0.17705064", "-0.66619396", "-0.71990156", "-1.1474525", "-0.3318813", "-0.35196233", "0.046396248", "-0.088710934", "0.81067836", "-0.09674793", "-0.13645045", "0.5741013", "-0.44870713", "0.5541442", "0.59215194", "0.21971606", "-1.2336998", "0.8620468", "0.031586297", "-0.77617455", "-0.54861504", "-0.19705719", "1.8035653", "-0.20619352", "0.92845106", "-0.22524264", "-0.6367142", "1.1455961", "-0.05870058", "0.30481437", "1.0592822", "0.014381139", "-0.26716578", "-0.21215354", "-0.5672266", "0.74361366", "1.9330093", "-0.00877388", "0.18851483", "0.45633894", "0.761344", "0.009881357", "-0.36917242", "0.2940756", "0.28931478", "-0.7497717", "1.3961916", "-0.8067613", "0.796026", "0.21780439", "2.4365244", "-0.4648755", "1.7250807", "-0.5733249", "-0.41961274", "-0.22476669", "0.8127243", "-0.6474011", "-0.515833", "-0.25425774", "-0.260898", "-0.18642695"]}
