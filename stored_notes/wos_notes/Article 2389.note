A rapid subtractive hybridization approach (RaSH) was used to identify differentially expressed genes in the pathogenic form of P. fermentans by comparing the cDNA of P. fermentans sampled after 24 hours growth on apple with the cDNA of the same strain grown 24 hours on peach fruit. A total of 450 clones were analysed by a reverse Northern Blotting technique, yielding some fragments which were significantly expressed on peach but less on apple tissue.
