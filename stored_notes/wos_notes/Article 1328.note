{"title": "Article 1328", "body": "The innate immune system, which includes toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling, plays an important role in inflammation and oncogenesis. Although TLR common adaptor myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) is known to have multiple effects on carcinogenesis, the role of MyD88 in hepatocarcinogenesis remains unknown. In this study, MyD88 expression was examined in 105 samples of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissue by immunohistochemistry, Western blot, and quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction methods. The relationships between MyD88 expression and clinical and pathological parameters were analyzed. The results showed that attenuated expression of MyD88 in HCC tissue tumor cells was significantly related to hepatitis B virus infection, large tumor size, positive vascular invasion, and intrahepatic metastasis (P<0.05). Western blot analysis of MyD88 protein in nine normal livers and 28 HCCs showed gender disparity (P<0.01, P<0.05), and attenuated expression in cirrhotic livers (P<0.05). Low expression of MyD88 mRNA was evident in HCCs with vascular invasion (P<0.01). In contrast to previous reports, these results suggest that attenuated expression of MyD88 in HCC is associated with tumor progression.\n", "text": "The innate immune system, which includes toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling, plays an important role in inflammation and oncogenesis.
