{"title": "Article 1193", "body": "It has recently become apparent that it is possible to characterize productively recombined, T-cell receptor (TcR) gene segments in tumor exome files, which presumably include representations of the DNA of other cells in the microenvironment. Similar characterizations have been done for TcR recombinations in tumor specimen RNASeq files. While exome files have been used to characterize immunoglobulin gene segment recombinations for tumors closely related to B-cells, immunoglobulin recombinations have yet to be characterized for putative microenvironment cells for solid tumors. Here we report a novel scripted algorithm that detects productive and unproductive immunoglobulin recombinations in both B-cell related tumor exome files and in solid tumor exome files, with the most important result being the relatively high level B-cell infiltrate in breast cancer. This analysis has the potential of streamlining and dramatically augmenting the knowledge base regarding B-cell infiltrates into solid tumors; and leading to antibody reagents directed against tumor antigens and tissue resident, infectious pathogens.\n", "text": "It has recently become apparent that it is possible to characterize productively recombined, T-cell receptor (TcR) gene segments in tumor exome files, which presumably include representations of the DNA of other cells in the microenvironment.
