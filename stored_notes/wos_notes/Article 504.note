Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their tissue inhibitors (TIMPs) are involved in the tissue remodelling processes. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether AngII modulates TIMP-2 expression in rat aortic smooth muscle cells in vivo. 2. Angiotensin II (200 ng/kg per min, s.c.) or AngII + losartan (10 mg/kg per day, s.c.) or normal saline was administered continuously by osmotic minipumps to Sprague-Dawley rats for 1 week. In addition, the effect of endogenous AngII on TIMP-2 expression was evaluated in renovascular hypertensive rats (two kidney, one clip (2K1C) and one kidney, one clip (1K1C) models). Control rats (sham 2K1C and sham 1K1C rats) underwent sham-clipping of the left renal artery. At the end of the treatment, plasma renin activity was measured by radioimmunoassay, aortic TIMP-2 mRNA expression was evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction and/or northern blotting and protein expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured twice a week by the tail-cuff method. 3. Exogenous AngII administration produced the expected increase in SBP (P = 0.02) compared with the control saline-treated group. The increase in SBP was abolished in AngII + losartan-treated rats. Administration of AngII caused a significant increase in TIMP-2 expression (P = 0.01) in rat aortic smooth muscle cells that was abolished in AngII + losartan-treated rats. In renovascular hypertensive rats, SBP was higher (P < 0.0001) in 2K1C and 1K1C rats compared with the corresponding sham-operated rats. Plasma renin activity was higher (P < 0.01) in 2K1C rats compared with the other groups. The expression of TIMP-2 was significantly (P < 0.05) increased only in 2K1C rats. 4. Our in vivo data demonstrate that exogenous and endogenous AngII increases TIMP-2 expression in rat aortic smooth muscle cells. This effect is not dependent on the AngII-induced increase in blood pressure and is mediated by angiotensin AT(1) receptors.\n"}]}, "text": "1.
