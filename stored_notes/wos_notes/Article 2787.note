The deduced amino acid sequences of this cDNA show similarity to plant non-specific lipid transfer proteins. Northern blotting assay revealed that this nsLTP-like gene, designated LJAMP2, was expressed in seeds. Overexpression of LJAMP2 in tobacco enhanced resistance to the fungal pathogen Alternaria alternata and the bacterial pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum, significantly, while no visible alteration in plant growth and development.
