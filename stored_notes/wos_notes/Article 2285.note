{"title": "Article 2285", "body": "Background/aim: An in-depth understanding of the early phase of type 1 diabetes (TID) pathogenesis is important for targeting primary prevention. We examined if 14 preselected mediators of immune responses differed in neonates that later developed TID compared to control neonates. Methods: The study is a case-control study with a 1:2 matching. The individuals were born between 1981 through 2002. Cases were validated using the National Patient Register and the Danish Childhood Diabetes Register. Interleukin(1)-1 beta, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, interferon gamma, tumor necrosis factor alpha, transforming growth factor beta I (active form), leptin, adiponectin, c-reactive protein, mannose-binding lectin and soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 were measured by using a flowmetric Luminex xMAP (R) technology. We tested two models both including a number of possible confounders. In the first model (model 1) we also adjusted for HLA-DQ beta 1) genotype. A total of 1930 groups of assay-matched cases and controls (4746 individuals) were included in the statistical analyses. Results: Adiponectin was negatively associated with later risk of TID in both models (relative change (RC), model 1: 0.95, P = 0.046 and model 2: 0.95, P = 0.006). IL-10 and IL-12 were both positively associated with T1D risk in the model 2 (RC, 1.19, P = 0.006 and 1.07, P = 0.02, respectively) these results were borderline significant in model 1, but showed the same direction as the results from model 2. Conclusions: Our results indicate that specific immunological signatures are already present at time of birth in children developing T1D before the age of 18 years. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.
