{"title": "Article 639", "body": {"ops": [{"insert": "Cotton (Gossypium L.) fiber is a unique experimental system for studying plant cell elongation and cell wall biogenesis. Arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs) are extracellular proteoglycans and play important roles in various aspects of plant growth and development. In the present work, four AGP genes, GhAGP2, GhAGP3, GhAGP4, and GhFLA1, were cloned from cotton fiber through 5' and 3' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). All these genes code for classical AGPs containing N-terminal signal sequence, a central domain rich in Ala, Ser, Thr, Pro/Hyp, and C-terminal hydrophobic transmembrane domain.

Northern blotting analysis with gene-specific probes indicates the transcripts of GhAGP2 and GhFLA1 accumulate in Gossypium hirsutum fiber from 5 to 20 days post anthesis, whereas GhAGP3 and GhAGP4 are abundantly expressed during the developmental stage switching from elongation to the secondary cell wall synthesis.
