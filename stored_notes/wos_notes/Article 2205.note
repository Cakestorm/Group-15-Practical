This paper estimates the capacity value of a load-shifting resource which is capable of providing multiple services. The capacity value represents the contribution of a resource to generation adequacy and an understanding of this contribution is important to compare how different power system resources can assist power system operators and planners. Additionally, policy-makers and market operators need an appreciation of the capacity value of different resources in order to design capacity remuneration mechanisms. A building energy model coupled with a power system model, co-optimizing the supplyside and the demand-side, is employed in this paper to estimate the capacity value of a specific load shifting resource. The resource examined is electric thermal storage heating devices for space and water heating. Ireland is used as a test case. It was found that these load-shifting devices can provide an adequacy contribution to the power system and thus have a capacity value. The capacity value, for the Irish case, can be up to 26% for the DR resource in question for the given year but the values are typically much lower due to operational constraints (reserve provision) and due to occupancy profile impacts. The results highlight the need for holistic modeling of demand response resources, as well as the need for additional work for different load-shifting resources and more data. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
