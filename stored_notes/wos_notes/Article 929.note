{"title": "Article 929", "body": "Plant beta-1, 3-glucanases are involved in plant defense and in development. Very little data are available on the expression of rice glucanases both in developmental tissues and under various stresses. In this study, we cloned and characterized twenty-seven rice beta-1, 3-glucanases (OsGlu) from at total of 71 putative glucanases. The OsGlu genes were obtained by PCR from a cDNA library and were classified into seven groups (Group I to VII) according to their DNA or amino acid sequence homology. Analysis of the expression of the twenty-seven OsGlu genes by Northern blotting revealed that they were differentially expressed in different developmental tissues as Well as in response to plant hormones, biotic stress, high salt etc. OsGlu11 and 27 in Group IV were clearly expressed only in stem and leaf and were also induced strongly by SA (5 mM), ABA (200 mu M), and M. grisea. OsGlu1, 10, 11, and 14 were induced earlier and to higher levels in incompatible M. grisea interaction than in compatible one. Taken together, our findings suggest that the twenty-seven rice OsGlu gene products play diverse roles not only in plant defense but also in hormonal responses and in development.\n", "text": "Plant beta-1, 3-glucanases are involved in plant defense and in development.
