{"title": "Article 2825", "body": "In response to overfeeding, geese develop fatty liver. To understand the fattening mechanism, mRNA differential display reverse transcription PCR was used to study the gene expression differences between French Landes grey geese and Xupu white geese in conditions of overfeeding and normal feeding. One gene was found to be up-regulated in the fatty liver in both breeds, and it has a 1797 bp cDNA with 83% identity to chicken SELENBP1. The sequence analysis revealed that its open reading frame of 1413 bp encodes a protein of 471 amino acids, which contains a putative conserved domain of 56 kDa selenium binding protein with high homology to its homologues of chicken (95%), rat (86%), mouse (84%), human (86%), monkey (86%), dog (86%), and cattle (86%). The function of this protein has been briefly reviewed based on published information. In tissue expression analysis, the expression of geese SELENBP1 mRNA was found to be higher in liver or kidney than in other tested tissues. The results showed that overfeeding could increase the mRNA expression level of geese SELENBP1.\n", "text": "In response to overfeeding, geese develop fatty liver.
