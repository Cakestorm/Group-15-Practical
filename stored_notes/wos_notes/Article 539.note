The system can be interrogated in numerous ways from simple text and sequence searches to sophisticated queries that apply 3D structural constraints.

A researcher's own sequences can also be analyzed through the web interface. A defining characteristic of abYsis is that the sequences are automatically numbered with a series of popular schemes such as Kabat and Chothia and then annotated with key information such as complementarity-determining regions and potential post-translational modifications. A unique aspect of abYsis is a set of residue frequency tables for each position in an antibody, allowing \"unusual residues\" (those rarely seen at a particular position) to be highlighted and decisions to be made on which mutations may be acceptable. This is especially useful when comparing antibodies from different species. abYsis is useful for any researcher specializing in antibody engineering, especially those developing antibodies as drugs. abYsis is available at www.abysis.org.
