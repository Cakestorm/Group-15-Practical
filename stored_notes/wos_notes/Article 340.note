{"body": "Background: Limited accessibility to providers may delay appropriate control of asthma exacerbations. The objective of our study is to estimate the contributors to the hospital/emergency department (ED) visits among adults with asthma focusing on the availability of healthcare providers. Methods: We conducted a pooled cross-sectional analysis using the 2011-2013 Asthma Call-Back Survey linked with 2012-2016 Area Health Resource Files. We employed multivariable logistic regression with dichotomous outcomes of hospitalization and ED visits. Key covariates were the availability of county-level healthcare provider variables per 100,000 persons such as the number of lung disease specialists (including pulmonary care specialists, and allergy and immunology specialists), the number of hospitals, the number of safety-net facilities including rural health centers (RHCs) and federally qualified health centers (FQHCs), and the number of primary care physicians (PCPs). Results: Among 25,621 adults, proportions of hospital visits and ED visits were 3.3% and 13.2%, respectively. An additional RHC reduced by 3% the odds of having an ED visit (odds ratio [OR] = 0.97, p=.004). Patients with cost barriers to seeing a PCP were 60% (OR = 1.60, p=.028) more likely to have a hospital visit than those without. In addition, patients with cost barriers to seeing a specialist were 90% (OR = 1.90, p=.007) and 111% (OR =2.11, p=.001) more likely to have a hospital visit and ED visit, respectively, than those without. Conclusions: Hospital and ED visits among adults with asthma are partially related to the availability of providers, and more related to financial barriers. Therefore, financial support for the vulnerable asthma population might be a target for policy makers interested in reducing hospitalizations and ED visits.\n", "embeddings": ["-0.017601304", "-0.5367302", "-1.2472161", "2.3999057", "0.029814271", "-1.1050177", "-2.2831202", "0.56966305", "1.1447932", "0.9154234", "-1.5632664", "-2.3806078", "-0.49428767", "0.49346995", "0.9994548", "0.26793325", "0.20002933", "-1.0423993", "-0.5744056", "-1.226804", "-1.0490699", "-2.3166108", "0.4151618", "0.7274601", "-1.0243046", "-1.6074984", "-0.4930854", "-0.5221938", "-1.6498245", "0.30845758", "1.5319102", "2.0035799", "0.8371388", "0.12112749", "-1.8420544", "-0.019861583", "-0.42630497", "0.59744644", "1.048279", "-0.5290167", "-1.3158054", "-1.0133065", "0.31217217", "-0.29546878", "-1.4030781", "0.058619805", "-0.35216492", "0.73681086", "-0.33137673", "1.3456225", "-0.26649147", "-0.67291915", "0.0077700396", "0.65667427", "-0.8863284", "-0.14401858", "1.0623015", "0.042005286", "1.1114969", "-1.0374293", "0.13606034", "0.8658627", "0.55629826", "-0.48230416", "-0.7876", "-1.6661292", "-1.5041748", "2.3082628", "-1.8537419", "1.4171942", "0.34254336", "-1.1387573", "-0.5437615", "-0.48877755", "1.3172581", "2.0669265", "0.08589341", "0.9687783", "-1.5400496", "0.009251462", "-0.29314205", "0.039713833", "-0.9489638", "1.5510894", "-0.012907944", "0.46575508", "0.075791076", "-0.55963176", "0.38785452", "-0.25799185", "-0.024286123", "1.4237751", "0.049809467", "-0.6239042", "1.4117483", "-1.7901754", "-0.6429563", "-0.45194504", "0.5395312", "-1.5032711", "-0.7881735", "0.8724395", "-0.46739435", "-0.5373733", "-1.8758293", "-1.0452696", "0.9191404", "2.0014236", "-1.3803327", "-0.30744138", "0.058830567", "-0.7327964", "1.4265704", "0.42173707", "-0.48543507", "-1.55208", "0.995395", "-0.80205435", "0.009562808", "-0.6377934", "0.30360627", "0.7005283", "0.3908117", "-0.051000953", "0.2235715", "0.24969958", "-1.2649999", "-0.06530736", "1.6072358", "1.5241853", "1.4190924", "0.81004864", "0.5393906", "-1.5166103", "0.5499479", "-0.29521692", "-0.8992877", "0.9982398", "1.8235279", "-1.5678898", "-1.7975558", "1.6677587", "-0.7874435", "-0.065510236", "0.05092699", "0.26611292", "0.56562626", "0.6665129", "0.34395066", "0.22781037", "-0.39605007", "1.5148382", "-0.53847647", "1.9009631", "-1.3309431", "0.72608405", "-0.2162076", "0.8165083", "-0.34299466", "-1.0931708", "0.79127085", "1.0974605", "-0.034509104", "-0.48643672", "-0.39658344", "0.5866554", "-0.20841575", "1.2551719", "-0.2784895", "-0.7684846", "-0.9403532", "-0.8288829", "1.0279949", "0.5777518", "-0.5174597", "-0.8622848", "-0.9848086", "0.8662111", "1.567653", "-1.0142802", "1.7914133", "1.490998", "-0.21974654", "0.47505167", "1.1961591", "-2.1139867", "-0.04021095", "0.68966305", "0.10002789", "-0.108053535", "1.17621", "-0.61874926", "-1.3543965", "-1.034351", "0.31602395", "0.093490005", "-0.04184444", "2.2361567", "0.31866854", "0.08784868"]}
