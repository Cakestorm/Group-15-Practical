When biomedical knowledge of the body in sport sciences tends to shrink the body to physiological attributes, such as muscle mass and fat percentage, our analysis stresses the agency of the lived body as a source of knowledge in physical activity.\n"}]}, "text": "Bodily knowledge has attracted significant attention within the humanities and other related fields over the last two decades.
