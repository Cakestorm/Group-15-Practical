{"body": "Background: STAT3 signaling plays the pivotal role in tumorigenesis through EZH2 epigenetic modification, which enhanced STAT3 activity by increased tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3. Here, another possible feedback mechanism and clinical significance of EZH2 and STAT3 were investigated in gastric cancer (GC). Methods: STAT3, p-STAT3 (Tyr 705) and EZH2 expression were examined in 63 GC specimens with matched normal tissues by IHC staining. EZH2 and STAT3 were also identified in five GC cell lines using RT-PCR and western blot analyses. p-STAT3 protein was detected by western blotting. In order to investigate whether EZH2 expression was directly regulated by STAT3, EZH2 expression was further detected using siRNA for STAT3 or IL-6 stimulation, with dual luciferase reporter analyses, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. The clinical significance of STAT3, p-STAT3 and EZH2 expression was evaluated by multi-factor COX regression and Kaplan-Meier analyses. Results: Hyper-activation of STAT3, p-STAT3 and EZH2 expression were observed in GC cells and tissues. STAT3 signaling was correlated with EZH2 expression in GC (R = 0.373, P = 0.003), which was consistent with our data showing that STAT3 as the transcriptional factor enhanced EZH2 transcriptional activity by binding the relative promoter region (-214 similar to-206). STAT3 was an independent signature for poor survival (P = 0.002). Patients with STAT3(+)/EZH2(+) or p-STAT3(+)/EZH2(+) had a worse outcome than others (P < 0.001); Besides, high levels of STAT3 and EZH2 was associated with advanced TNM staging (P = 0.017). Moreover, treatment with a combination of siSTAT3 and EZH2-specific inhibitor, 3-deazaneplanocin A (DZNEP), increased the apoptotic ratio of cells. It is benefit for targeting STAT3-EZH2 interplay in GC treatment. Conclusions: Our results indicate that STAT3 status mediated EZH2 upregulation, associated with advanced TNM stage and poor prognosis, suggesting that combination with knockdown of STAT3 and EZH2 inhibitor might be a novel therapy in GC treatment. Collectively, STAT3, p-STAT3 and EZH2 expression were provided for the precision medicine in GC patients.\n", "embeddings": ["0.009394635", "0.8051313", "-1.0287712", "-0.02098445", "-0.77139026", "-1.0505104", "-1.0042816", "1.759614", "-1.8431741", "-1.6703832", "0.44487253", "-0.07572913", "-0.3251938", "-1.4026012", "-2.0693276", "-1.1441193", "0.79700375", "-1.1711805", "-2.4807546", "-3.2907755", "-0.1464008", "-0.787177", "-1.5200927", "-0.5342553", "-1.0928955", "-0.55677193", "-0.4708987", "0.49138823", "1.1078602", "-0.39046904", "1.3341308", "0.31399378", "0.55249643", "-0.03789908", "1.0432765", "0.0044658002", "0.523329", "-1.5847834", "0.57790774", "0.24063593", "0.2244404", "-1.502276", "-0.32472458", "-0.089131385", "0.13360816", "0.2990118", "-0.3920827", "-1.1967064", "0.61969095", "0.46234903", "0.0016799613", "-1.4132129", "-0.49271753", "-0.55733305", "1.4529446", "1.4628445", "-1.3159424", "-0.26358354", "-2.023437", "1.2505052", "-0.062093295", "1.0300072", "0.5206152", "0.46280202", "-0.24090049", "0.8959133", "0.09659572", "0.47775722", "-0.42960382", "0.621541", "0.058864348", "2.6520092", "0.3740335", "-0.22104241", "1.8639235", "0.896802", "0.62753236", "-1.1610771", "0.25187427", "0.034944933", "-0.037206206", "1.2179981", "-0.19276296", "0.3045894", "-0.04957881", "0.8940407", "-0.57347864", "-0.43489617", "0.14364222", "-0.15311761", "-0.29022253", "0.2608338", "0.6528499", "0.6371804", "-0.6330494", "0.92324436", "-0.84510714", "0.48759076", "-1.3356963", "0.26282245", "0.8089194", "1.6664304", "0.9375431", "-0.28717142", "1.1312412", "-3.0866566", "0.23166563", "-0.49176016", "0.08175458", "0.15361504", "-0.58855605", "-1.5044154", "-0.64004284", "0.6880469", "2.1899595", "-2.2778232", "1.280589", "-1.0365231", "-2.5821965", "-0.3905044", "0.75808585", "0.21406752", "-0.16723143", "-0.69272953", "-1.0234728", "1.3576247", "-1.0126569", "-1.4108462", "0.009837289", "0.5104053", "-0.48283553", "-1.2121884", "1.1757929", "0.42443904", "-0.48739833", "0.8650688", "-0.00211909", "-1.1001073", "-0.016409233", "-0.62883747", "-0.60898805", "-0.8659588", "0.5202208", "-0.5959244", "0.6581337", "-0.6155503", "-0.06108709", "0.3688583", "0.3861277", "0.66080964", "1.4226067", "-0.6222534", "-1.2226261", "0.013071861", "-0.9225453", "2.138863", "1.503858", "2.2064328", "-0.4896106", "-0.52431494", "2.4951942", "-0.5933507", "1.2742455", "0.13629062", "-0.68155557", "0.4469582", "-0.10284961", "0.11912589", "-1.0193665", "0.49161527", "-0.6127874", "-1.5891985", "1.7412932", "-0.6554796", "1.9435279", "-0.4428197", "-0.1979786", "1.2994696", "0.47371358", "0.19298123", "-0.27141282", "-0.15373278", "-0.81144756", "-0.96525705", "0.18913084", "-0.6769956", "0.80659634", "-0.6890061", "1.0266696", "0.036549285", "1.6424096", "-0.40877333", "-0.17973468", "0.73920435", "0.40235183", "0.40134108", "-0.029672852", "-0.5279114", "-0.6016014", "-1.0631813"]}
