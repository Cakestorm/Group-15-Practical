MethodsWe conducted a questionnaire survey of hospitalized patients under 24months old with a diagnosis of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) from January 2011 to December 2013. Eleven large-scale general hospitals in Yokohama, Japan were surveyed, which provide centralized inpatient care to moderately-severely ill children. ResultsA total of 51 ICH patients were listed from eight hospitals. Median patient age was 7months, and 84% were younger than 12months. The most common diagnosis on computed tomography was subdural hematoma (n=26; 51%). Of a total of 51 cases, 31 (61%) occurred inside the home; the injury scene was unknown in six cases (12%). We reviewed these 37 cases from the viewpoint of evaluation with concern for suspected child abuse. Three out of 37 patients (8%) were not examined for inflicted skin lesions, and skeletal surveys and funduscopy were not conducted in 14 (38%) and 15 (41%), respectively. Thirteen out of 37 cases (35%) were not reported to hospital-based child protection teams and 22 (59%) were not reported to regional child protective services. ConclusionThe sociomedical evaluation of possible child abuse appears to be systematically inadequate in Yokohama.\n"}]}, "text": "BackgroundThere have been no previous studies on the adequacy of combined evaluation of possible abusive head trauma cases by frontline medical personnel, hospital-based child protection teams, and child protective services in local districts of Japan.
