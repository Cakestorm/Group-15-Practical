{"body": "BackgroundThere have been no previous studies on the adequacy of combined evaluation of possible abusive head trauma cases by frontline medical personnel, hospital-based child protection teams, and child protective services in local districts of Japan. MethodsWe conducted a questionnaire survey of hospitalized patients under 24months old with a diagnosis of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) from January 2011 to December 2013. Eleven large-scale general hospitals in Yokohama, Japan were surveyed, which provide centralized inpatient care to moderately-severely ill children. ResultsA total of 51 ICH patients were listed from eight hospitals. Median patient age was 7months, and 84% were younger than 12months. The most common diagnosis on computed tomography was subdural hematoma (n=26; 51%). Of a total of 51 cases, 31 (61%) occurred inside the home; the injury scene was unknown in six cases (12%). We reviewed these 37 cases from the viewpoint of evaluation with concern for suspected child abuse. Three out of 37 patients (8%) were not examined for inflicted skin lesions, and skeletal surveys and funduscopy were not conducted in 14 (38%) and 15 (41%), respectively. Thirteen out of 37 cases (35%) were not reported to hospital-based child protection teams and 22 (59%) were not reported to regional child protective services. ConclusionThe sociomedical evaluation of possible child abuse appears to be systematically inadequate in Yokohama.\n", "embeddings": ["0.8095832", "-1.1659414", "0.5352115", "0.85583335", "0.4532204", "0.2661719", "0.28452522", "0.8917319", "0.61687875", "0.26356325", "-0.14340687", "-1.3276168", "-0.07257796", "-0.26750126", "-0.7345137", "-0.18038611", "0.49729717", "0.7999014", "1.8009729", "-1.4435002", "0.2366168", "-1.122954", "-0.18059997", "-0.18559675", "-0.6346878", "-0.37981117", "-1.6483006", "-0.8781289", "0.7770402", "-0.23774895", "-0.542786", "0.14391167", "0.75376856", "-0.7672934", "-0.19885595", "-1.5404427", "-0.46234924", "-0.597418", "1.175258", "0.436891", "-0.36551833", "-0.8832453", "0.19366612", "-1.4943981", "1.4569559", "0.14306144", "0.18105897", "-0.2855843", "-0.2701207", "-0.062409252", "1.0569321", "-0.09350801", "-0.041529097", "-1.3653448", "-0.22422132", "-0.22894217", "0.48895776", "-0.050987564", "0.39173445", "-0.20232296", "-0.36760905", "0.1328507", "0.5314242", "0.58361906", "-1.3554941", "-0.13939373", "0.046977643", "0.41577727", "0.36866143", "-1.2303473", "0.79326236", "0.48226818", "0.7273343", "1.3633561", "-0.11921558", "1.1653138", "1.3627971", "-0.62849116", "-2.1198702", "0.37303817", "-1.1745486", "-2.2196493", "0.17060748", "0.7332396", "-0.45663902", "-1.024139", "0.01734095", "0.3782246", "-0.8885797", "-0.49706382", "0.5705459", "0.104967296", "0.69468933", "0.30356082", "0.5892844", "-0.34665534", "-0.50644845", "1.2486495", "0.17376679", "-1.3601103", "1.3361971", "0.7949296", "-1.1653073", "-0.6695985", "-0.26091027", "-1.5404301", "-0.54292005", "2.929737", "-1.3595839", "-1.5065762", "-0.4538608", "-1.1355846", "-0.77842283", "1.3546871", "0.6244886", "-0.41703278", "1.0980563", "-0.28516367", "-0.962577", "-0.47315168", "1.1066889", "0.7859824", "1.2971647", "0.5314924", "0.67130315", "0.14304906", "-0.34663963", "0.8526442", "0.1481462", "1.1043962", "1.7680689", "-0.57957137", "0.5581244", "-0.067486085", "-0.6474185", "1.1588216", "-0.2286998", "-0.94168204", "-0.74882895", "-0.7270726", "-0.65513194", "2.1983507", "-0.2976458", "-0.070592694", "-0.30938184", "-0.17945988", "2.0799887", "-0.29806143", "0.38376728", "2.4831703", "-1.0378342", "-0.40181437", "-0.53954285", "-1.298303", "-1.566887", "0.90454113", "-1.0665895", "-0.38572612", "0.6365626", "-0.12639074", "0.8712072", "0.79568917", "0.75675166", "0.79753464", "-0.50606406", "0.18277693", "-0.48609298", "-1.2325749", "-0.7222543", "0.6626457", "0.12667154", "-1.1605935", "-0.017733589", "0.49521682", "0.080822065", "-0.42534634", "0.27635142", "0.5171969", "0.73087734", "-0.32925898", "0.8133548", "1.1763169", "-0.58973163", "-0.34563074", "0.2528197", "-1.2418457", "-0.6985195", "0.74242413", "0.079721354", "-0.04073447", "0.5378551", "-1.229173", "0.69847345", "-1.0089625", "1.3517275", "1.066051", "0.88363624", "-1.6378274", "1.0863354", "0.05033943"]}
