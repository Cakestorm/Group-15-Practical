Specific antiserum was raised against the recombinant protein and used for Western blotting to test whether the ORF3 protein is the CsNIV coat protein. One major CsNIV protein of approximately 46 kDa reacted positively with the antiserum, suggesting that this antiserum is specific for the CsNIV coat protein. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) analysis of the 46 kDa structural band revealed 14 peptide sequences that matched the ORF3 regions of CsNIV. The expression of ORF3 in host cells was examined by constructing a cDNA library of CsNIV-infected cells. Nucleotide sequences of the cDNA clones were complementary to various regions of both CsNIV ORF3 and ORF4; however, no clones containing only the ORF3 region were identified.
