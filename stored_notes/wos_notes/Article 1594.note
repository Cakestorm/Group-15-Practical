{"title": "Article 1594", "body": "In relation to child abuse, child neglect has been understudied even though it is more common and causes at least as much harm. While child maltreatment (in a single category) has been linked to substance use disorders (SUD), and while child abuse alone (without neglect) has been linked to SUD, it remains unclear whether differences exist in the link between SUD and child abuse alone (without neglect) versus SUD and child neglect alone (without abuse). Utilising the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being II (NSCAW II, 2014): Wave I - 2008-09; Wave II - 18months later: N=5872), we used logistic regression to longitudinally assess whether past-year abuse versus past-year neglect in Wave I are equally influential in predicting newly diagnosed substance dependence in Wave II (among youth without SUD in Wave I). After adjusting for several factors, we found that past-year child neglect in Wave I was a significant predictor of newly diagnosed substance dependence in Wave II among youth who did not have SUD in Wave I. Other forms of youth maltreatment were unrelated. The findings suggest that child welfare and substance abuse professionals could pay special attention to youth with past-year neglect in order to help prevent the emergence of new substance dependence disorders.
