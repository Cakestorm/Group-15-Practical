{"title": "Article 2869", "body": "FK506 binding protein (FBBP) 14 belongs to the family of FKBPs. Altered expression of FKBPs are observed in several malignancies. The present study aimed to explore the expression and biological function of FKBP14 in gastric cancer. FKBP14 expression levels in 40 gastric cancer samples and matched control samples were evaluated using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Cell proliferation was evaluated using Cell Counting kit-8 assay. A cell adhesion and a Transwell assay were performed to detect cell adhesion and invasion. Protein expression was determined using western blot analysis. It was found that FKBP14 expression in gastric cancer tissues was elevated compared with normal tissues. Silencing of FKBP14 expression in the gastric cancer MKN-45 and AGS cell lines, which have a higher expression level of FKBP14 compared with four other gastric cancer cell lines, significantly inhibited cellular proliferation, adhesion and invasion. In addition, the protein levels of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, matrix metalloproteinase 2 and the epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) markers beta-catenin, Snail1 and Twist were repressed in gastric cancer cells with FKBP14 silenced. In conclusion, FKBP14 may act as an oncogene by suppressing cellular proliferation, adhesion and invasion and EMT in gastric carcinogenesis. FKBP14 may be a diagnosis marker and potential therapeutic target in gastric cancer.\n", "text": "FK506 binding protein (FBBP) 14 belongs to the family of FKBPs.
