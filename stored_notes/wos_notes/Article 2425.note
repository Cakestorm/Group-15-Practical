The circadian preference toward eveningness has been associated with sleep problems in previous studies. Here, we studied whether evening-type women had more sleep problems during their pregnancy, as compared with other chronotypes, in a sample consisting of 1653 pregnant women from the Finnish CHILD-SLEEP Birth Cohort. Chronotype was assessed with a shortened version of the morningness-eveningness questionnaire. Pregnant evening-type women reported more sleep problems, including troubles of falling asleep ( OR = 3.4, p < 0.0001), poor sleep quality ( OR = 2.9, p < 0.01) and daily tiredness ( OR = 3.2, p < 0.0001) than the morning-type women, even after controlling for sleep duration and sleep deprivation. They had higher scores on Epworth Sleepiness Scale ( p < 0.05), Basic Nordic Sleep Questionnaire ( p < 0.0001) and Global Seasonality Score ( p < 0.01) and were also more often smokers, also during pregnancy ( p < 0.001) and reported poorer general health ( p < 0.001) than the morning-type women. They also reported having had more sleep problems during their childhood ( OR = 1.5, p < 0.05) and adolescence ( OR = 2.0, p < 0.001) than the morning-type women. Our results indicate that eveningness is associated with more sleep problems and unhealthy life habits during pregnancy.\n"}]}, "text": "Sleep problems during pregnancy impair maternal health and increase the risk for adverse pregnancy outcome.
