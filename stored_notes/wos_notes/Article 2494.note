Modular multilevel converters (MMC) have been applied to static synchronous compensators (STATCOM), high-voltage direct-current transmission (HVDCT), back-to-back power transfer systems, wind/solar power generation and battery storage systems. The D-Sigma digital control is adopted to track current reference, balance dc-bus capacitor voltage and regulate cell module capacitor voltage. The adopted D-Sigma digital control can accommodate wide filter inductance variation and take care of source voltage harmonics to achieve fast tracking response and low-distortion output current for the applications of active and reactive power injection and rectification with power factor correction. Based on power-balance principle, the combination of dc offset current and the ac current of each arm can be determined. According to charge-balance principle and with the D-Sigma digital control, dc-bus capacitor voltage balancing and cell voltage regulation can be achieved.
