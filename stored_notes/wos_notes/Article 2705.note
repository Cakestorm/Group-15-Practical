{"title": "Article 2705", "body": "In Pisum sativum, the short-chain alcohol dehydrogenase-like protein (SAD) gene family consists of at least three members (SAD-A, -B, and -C). Expression of two of these genes (SAD-A and -C) in Escherichia coli or Pichia pastoris resulted in full-length soluble proteins. Purified SAD-A was used as antigen for antibody production in rabbits. With these antibodies the recombinant SAD-C protein (which was most highly expressed of the two isoforms) was shown to be a tetramer consisting of a dinner of dimers. The SAD genes are transiently expressed in plants by short exposures to ultraviolet-B radiation (UV-B), as judged by northern blotting. In turn, mRNA accumulation leads to formation of SAD protein in leaf and stem tissue upon prolonged UV-B irradiation. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
