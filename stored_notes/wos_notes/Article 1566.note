{"body": "Fractures are the second most common presentation of child abuse following soft-tissue bruising and burns. It is often difficult to determine potential abuse in a child presenting with a non-rib fracture(s) and without soft-tissue injuries. One hundred and fifteen consecutive patients aged a parts per thousand currency sign2 years who presented with a fracture between January 2010 and June 2012 to our emergency department (ED) or pediatric fracture clinic were retrospectively analyzed. Statistical analyses were carried out for non-accidental fractures based on age (< 1 year vs 1-2 years), location of presentation (ED vs pediatric fracture clinic), type of long bone fracture, number of fractures, and patient demographics. Fractures in 19 of 115 (17 %) patients were reported as non-accidental trauma (NAT). Eighty (70 %) of the 115 patients first reported to the ED. Thirty-two percent of fractures in children aged < 1 year and 5 % of fractures in children aged 1-2 years were reported as NAT (p < 0.001). Sixteen of 19 (84 %) patients reported for abuse had multiple fractures; 15 of these patients were aged < 1 year. Eight of 11 (73 %) reported femoral fractures were transverse fractures. Corner fractures (12) only occurred in children aged < 1 year and never occurred in isolation; all of them were reported as NAT. Four of 60 patients (7 %) with commercial insurance and 15 of 55 patients (28 %) with Medicaid were reported as NAT. Age less than 1 year, multiple fractures, corner fractures, transverse fractures, and covered by Medicaid were the most common factors associated with reporting of NAT.\n", "embeddings": ["0.5898255", "-0.76367754", "1.3181716", "-0.32542872", "1.6015095", "-1.0191183", "1.6184465", "0.50666493", "-0.0021552418", "-0.95459473", "-0.8943031", "-1.2570198", "-0.37039703", "-0.38233584", "-0.60030645", "0.46433014", "-0.8477448", "-1.4115427", "1.1763207", "-1.7366738", "0.55725837", "-0.8298914", "1.0261312", "-1.9430895", "0.049314402", "-0.3688853", "-0.6380129", "-1.1774409", "-1.9654927", "-0.4016894", "1.1033168", "0.90776247", "0.8204601", "0.46113542", "0.4235012", "-0.24442571", "-1.5737902", "-1.2881877", "0.30475277", "0.11064364", "0.6619072", "0.07350779", "-0.92838824", "0.2342854", "2.202044", "-0.7240908", "-1.6529481", "0.3301066", "-1.2182784", "-1.4518955", "-0.06478608", "1.0472982", "-0.1574298", "0.82403296", "-0.86248946", "0.069173716", "-0.047448926", "-0.4505762", "1.261193", "-0.028134631", "-0.16840751", "0.14976603", "-0.18823789", "1.2635256", "-1.1747402", "0.8936442", "0.87291694", "2.2736177", "1.6203083", "-0.5598741", "1.3749319", "0.025155313", "1.0260234", "0.16502953", "-0.14261253", "1.4036378", "1.4724451", "0.13724498", "-2.726987", "0.97740304", "-1.6730876", "-1.3220595", "-0.33392718", "0.23667338", "-0.6090494", "-0.80952626", "-0.22095415", "-1.6578368", "-0.17642674", "-1.4408486", "0.79311854", "-0.29475293", "0.24061547", "-0.095842175", "0.4671707", "0.78509057", "-1.634916", "0.82951295", "-0.4254137", "-1.3034613", "0.034753084", "0.52258986", "0.8366994", "-0.3070249", "0.16695781", "-1.5886384", "0.047894888", "2.1236975", "-1.5067961", "-0.7042477", "-0.2095802", "-0.9620344", "-0.59044963", "-1.4374322", "0.40866405", "-0.36188552", "0.08555349", "1.7224727", "-0.38008425", "-1.9451292", "-1.0119227", "-0.7378378", "-0.12527081", "0.7160032", "0.1724621", "-0.04896984", "0.56013215", "0.31236807", "-0.9480092", "-0.6039956", "1.7309651", "-0.6411455", "0.9235351", "-0.17303798", "0.65381944", "0.88115835", "0.4817538", "0.10326342", "-1.7958347", "-1.1788187", "-0.766303", "1.4232529", "-0.9169973", "0.21462458", "0.6036946", "-1.0636228", "1.4262004", "0.44485143", "0.38828513", "0.40644664", "-0.7856656", "0.72807145", "-0.30760568", "-0.3142319", "-1.6015646", "0.57943946", "-0.68794435", "-0.5795801", "-0.36549982", "-1.4790732", "-1.1414096", "1.0526212", "-0.3032219", "0.87870926", "-0.503195", "1.7334142", "1.6392158", "-1.2909495", "-0.6715656", "0.0008133852", "0.5612425", "-0.36513633", "0.3081054", "-0.2811902", "0.87170446", "0.2703377", "0.15822075", "0.8161674", "1.9627166", "-1.1931795", "0.25891444", "1.6835316", "0.26394716", "0.25515217", "0.26229984", "-1.2092732", "-1.44197", "-0.06593115", "0.80562454", "0.05503974", "1.093827", "0.18660234", "0.33394864", "0.43060935", "1.5609719", "-0.118769586", "1.3211838", "-0.9073214", "-1.5440794", "-0.565143"]}
