The sensor has a temperature responsivity of 33.0 pm/degrees C with a linearity of more than 0.97 as well as a current responsitivity of 1.46 degrees C/A(2), and has significant potential for application as a health and warning sensor for electricity generation and distribution grids.\n"}]}, "text": "A new microbent in-line microfiber interferometer (MI-MI) is proposed and demonstrated as a compact temperature and current sensor.
