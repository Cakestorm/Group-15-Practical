{"body": "Background: Long-acting injectable antipsychotics are treatment options for acute and long-term treatment of patients with schizophrenia. In a previously published 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of patients with schizophrenia experiencing an acute psychotic episode, aripiprazole once-monthly 400 mg (AOM 400) produced significantly greater improvement than placebo on the primary endpoint, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score at week 10. Methods: To examine the efficacy of AOM 400 across a broader representation of schizophrenia symptoms, including agitation, a post hoc analysis of this trial was carried out to assess the change in PANSS Marder factor domains (positive symptoms, negative symptoms, disorganized thought, uncontrolled hostility/excitement, and anxiety/depression) and the PANSS excited component (equivalent to Marder factor domain uncontrolled hostility/excitement plus the tension item) by comparing differences in change from baseline between AOM 400 and placebo using a mixed model for repeated measures. Results: The differences between treatment and placebo for all factors were statistically significant, with improvements seen as early as week 1 or 2, and maintained through week 12. Thus, AOM 400, supplemented with oral aripiprazole in the first 2 weeks, showed significantly greater efficacy versus placebo in acutely ill patients with schizophrenia in all 5 Marder illness domains, as well as in agitation as conceptualized by the PANSS excited component score. Conclusions: These findings indicate that AOM 400 is efficacious across the spectrum of schizophrenia symptoms in acutely ill patients, with implications for both short-term and, by extension, long-term patient outcomes.\n", "embeddings": ["0.40672144", "-1.4956409", "0.8371802", "1.031302", "-0.027078614", "-0.31176135", "1.3048046", "1.2300211", "-0.566962", "-0.32937098", "-1.1892047", "-0.91644824", "-0.13119622", "1.2203486", "-2.042125", "-1.145077", "-0.4367592", "2.7324057", "-0.41707173", "-1.2158846", "-1.7384189", "0.41706094", "0.3646988", "-1.3401108", "0.5387079", "-0.554064", "0.485371", "-0.6016988", "-0.9674767", "-1.4005927", "-0.24490678", "1.5777143", "-0.7184431", "-0.32832116", "-0.72026956", "1.6338781", "0.8206926", "-0.0039424873", "-0.991039", "-0.19239761", "-1.6133305", "-0.4616513", "0.97159225", "-0.43596992", "-0.2768914", "0.12803143", "-0.7994705", "-0.7846993", "0.05539579", "1.3258992", "0.85363346", "-1.7852864", "-0.8459806", "-0.098912194", "1.3090922", "0.95465064", "0.80950546", "0.68240416", "-0.26563329", "-0.6500311", "-0.65656304", "1.1118461", "-0.68045586", "0.38005477", "-0.6867906", "-0.50114864", "-0.78616863", "0.57251686", "0.5210367", "1.8398565", "0.9472967", "0.88635147", "0.76251423", "1.6469865", "0.57510716", "1.270855", "-0.26110923", "-2.0060039", "-1.1225917", "0.7265098", "0.6599298", "-0.45685527", "-0.23299062", "2.0479484", "-1.4790937", "0.80686164", "-2.6947064", "0.5412417", "0.26167548", "-0.29409465", "2.0440786", "1.6872536", "-0.68465686", "0.64962125", "1.3728873", "-0.58509517", "1.0565498", "0.08802453", "0.3495421", "-0.0380087", "0.5622758", "-0.89495206", "0.38221225", "1.2618762", "0.10684966", "-2.5470743", "1.406897", "1.2342912", "0.5449189", "-1.1512451", "-0.3268078", "0.014721191", "-0.83098865", "0.5971283", "0.42686802", "-0.8124021", "0.9700174", "-0.9259591", "-0.11035634", "-0.8516542", "0.38524336", "0.29323727", "0.32991683", "-1.7061507", "0.921629", "1.4560932", "0.07190747", "-0.9135478", "0.5828816", "-1.1151031", "0.049988452", "1.4758881", "-0.85913163", "-0.15766786", "0.5539633", "0.34481058", "-0.58020735", "0.75694746", "-1.8788795", "0.59410346", "1.9024497", "1.8946025", "-1.2583231", "0.4370571", "-0.28665432", "0.1594873", "2.0871236", "-0.16157743", "0.5171934", "0.12249461", "-0.022507649", "-2.056208", "-1.133172", "0.040654752", "-3.1501658", "1.2218524", "-0.16237357", "0.06912854", "-1.0470065", "-0.8823852", "-0.96925807", "1.0048574", "0.46242633", "-0.14700346", "-0.5432832", "-0.8250779", "0.39428484", "-1.4120569", "0.58388925", "-0.44990018", "-0.78859085", "-0.5115283", "1.0440066", "0.5577989", "0.18659233", "0.82188463", "-0.2863365", "0.76369464", "0.64850307", "-0.6605146", "-0.8399108", "0.2506676", "0.012062356", "-1.0472326", "2.393253", "0.2243612", "-0.5690983", "1.1936944", "1.2523135", "1.2100401", "1.581151", "0.5363602", "-0.028101983", "0.5982654", "-0.45691282", "-0.34513795", "0.40132704", "0.7057454", "1.1631502", "-0.014551295"]}
