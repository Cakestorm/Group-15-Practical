{"title": "Article 2228", "body": "Fusarium Head Blight is a major disease of wheat and an important contributor to the reduced cultivation of wheat in South Africa, where the crop often is grown under irrigation. We collected Fusarium isolates from 860 Fusarium Head Blight-infected wheat heads in seven irrigated wheat-growing areas of South Africa. Six Fusarium species, i.e., F. chlamydosporum, F. crookwellense, F. culmorum, F. equiseti, F. graminearum and F. semitectum were recovered, three of which, i.e., F. chlamydosporum, F. equiseti and F. semitectum, were not previously associated with Fusarium Head Blight in South Africa. Fusarium graminearum occurred at high frequencies at all seven locations. Based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays of diagnostic sequences, more isolates were predicted to produce deoxynivalenol than nivalenol. Fusarium graminearum (sensu lato) appears to be the primary causal agent of Fusarium Head Blight in irrigated wheat in South Africa, which may not be the case for wheat cultivated under rain-fed conditions. Rotations of irrigated wheat with other graminaceous crops and maize could increase fungal inoculum and disease pressure. The establishment of Fusarium Head Blight in the irrigated wheat region of the country means that resistant lines and alternative agronomic practices are needed to limit disease severity, yield losses and mycotoxin contamination.\n", "text": "Fusarium Head Blight is a major disease of wheat and an important contributor to the reduced cultivation of wheat in South Africa, where the crop often is grown under irrigation.
