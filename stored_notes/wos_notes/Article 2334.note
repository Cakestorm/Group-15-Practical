{"title": "Article 2334", "body": "Recently, there has been an increase in the use of finite control set model predictive control (FCS-MPC) for power converters. Model predictive control (MPC) uses the discrete-time model of the system to predict future values of control variables for all possible control actions and computes a cost function related to control objectives. This control technique can provide fast dynamic response. However, MPC method implementation imposes a very high computational burden and causes significant hardware requirements for real-time implementation. In this paper, a fully field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based real-time implementation of MPC is proposed for direct matrix converter (DMC). In the proposed method, all control calculations and the safe commutation scheme for DMC are fully implemented in the FPGA and the need for another digital control platform, such as digital signal processors (DSP) or dSPACE, is eliminated. The proposed scheme takes full advantages of the parallel computation capability of FPGAs.\n", "text": "Recently, there has been an increase in the use of finite control set model predictive control (FCS-MPC) for power converters.
