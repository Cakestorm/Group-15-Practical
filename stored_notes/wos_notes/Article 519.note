{"title": "Article 519", "body": {"ops": [{"insert": "Numerous patients with anorectal malformations (ARMs) continue to experience fecal incontinence and constipation following surgical procedures. One of the most important factors that influences defecation is the striated muscle complex (SMC). Wnt signaling regulates the expression of myogenic regulatory factors, which serve an important role in muscle development. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the expression pattern of Wnt3a protein (by immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis) and mRNA [by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR)] in the SMC of ARM model rats that were exposed to ethylenethiourea. Immunostaining revealed that the expression of Wnt3a exhibits space-and time-dependent changes in the developing SMC of ARM model rat embryos. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that on embryonic day 17 (E17), Wnt3a-positive cells were observed in the SMC in normal embryos, and expression levels gradually increased as the rat embryos developed. Similar changes in Wnt3a protein expression were detected in ARM model rat embryos; however, the expression of Wnt3a was significantly reduced compared with the normal rat embryos. Western blotting and RT-qPCR also revealed lower expression levels of Wnt3a protein and mRNA, respectively, in the SMC of ARMs model rat embryos compared with normal rat embryos. These data revealed that the expression of Wnt3a in ARM embryos was notably reduced, indicating a potential role for Wnt3a in the maldevelopment of the SMC in patients with ARMs.\n"}]}, "text": "Numerous patients with anorectal malformations (ARMs) continue to experience fecal incontinence and constipation following surgical procedures.
