{"body": "Young children with suspected abusive head trauma often receive skull radiographs to evaluate for fractures as well as computed tomography (CT) of the head to assess for intracranial injury. Using a CT as the primary modality to evaluate both fracture and intracranial injury could reduce exposure to radiation without sacrificing performance. To evaluate the sensitivity of CT head with (3-D) reconstruction compared to skull radiographs to identify skull fractures in children with suspected abusive head trauma. This was a retrospective (2013-2014) cross-sectional study of infants evaluated for abusive head trauma via both skull radiographs and CT with 3-D reconstruction. The reference standard was skull radiography. All studies were read by pediatric radiologists and neuroradiologists, with ten percent read by a second radiologist to evaluate for interobserver reliability. One hundred seventy-seven children (47% female; mean/median age: 5 months) were included. Sixty-two (35%) had skull fractures by radiography. CT with 3-D reconstruction was 97% sensitive (95% confidence interval [CI]: 89-100%) and 94% specific (CI: 87-97%) for skull fracture. There was no significant difference between plain radiographs and 3-D CT scan results (P-value = 0.18). Kappa was 1 (P-value < 0.001) between radiologist readings of CTs and 0.77 (P = 0.001) for skull radiographs. CT with 3-D reconstruction is equivalent to skull radiographs in identifying skull fractures. When a head CT is indicated, skull radiographs add little diagnostic value.\n", "embeddings": ["-0.05358863", "-0.9922479", "-0.0358637", "-0.24802914", "1.5212877", "0.67718166", "1.7658359", "2.0583427", "-1.1558363", "-0.100456335", "-1.5620263", "-1.2227844", "1.1678815", "-0.28736445", "-1.2347642", "-0.062638365", "-0.31565526", "-0.804343", "1.6719509", "-0.5442816", "-0.6115421", "-0.33342734", "1.2705123", "-0.38583967", "0.68340135", "0.107718304", "-1.4515835", "0.4493466", "0.34937653", "-1.6740558", "0.21669188", "-0.95096236", "0.90973276", "0.75220716", "-0.9735586", "-0.20376077", "0.2375613", "-0.6333242", "0.25891283", "-0.4602269", "0.5435005", "-0.20120236", "1.039864", "-0.6562188", "0.9127681", "0.02890253", "-0.05863985", "-0.1876558", "-0.75768095", "0.4223418", "-0.27282426", "-0.16777392", "-0.56184286", "-0.15860766", "-1.5514283", "0.5441318", "0.40400138", "-0.53063107", "1.6880119", "-0.86871666", "-1.5369772", "-0.26835328", "-0.29728794", "-0.4685008", "-1.235025", "0.20417501", "1.3121356", "2.6538277", "1.3121408", "0.22121373", "-0.2055603", "-0.029958088", "0.82106197", "0.27914697", "-0.01216606", "-0.23704636", "-0.41915637", "-0.8725408", "-1.0338621", "-0.48041824", "-0.7865637", "-1.1619464", "0.20035522", "0.281474", "-0.49930295", "-0.12082524", "-0.86035943", "-0.3622351", "-0.81199044", "-0.9286906", "1.3389893", "-0.019326404", "0.78979474", "0.97906137", "0.9164511", "0.8488898", "-1.1064597", "-0.058577724", "-1.0060824", "-0.8000016", "0.21659495", "1.2850021", "1.0147812", "2.7935085", "-0.4565671", "-2.3202171", "-1.717672", "1.4994807", "-1.698673", "-2.6217828", "-0.6743467", "-1.3888978", "-0.53324074", "0.5842929", "0.8066374", "-1.65009", "0.5275818", "-1.3992398", "0.8322493", "-1.9103383", "0.8728509", "1.1818243", "-0.3030179", "-0.25896764", "0.65325636", "-0.32202372", "-0.7498653", "0.12773153", "0.17689513", "-0.84930414", "1.1302333", "-1.2285722", "0.15016608", "-0.6244739", "-0.9578874", "-1.2384326", "-0.5035264", "-0.77839315", "-0.36121422", "0.86248046", "-0.29020175", "-0.02387822", "-0.21127173", "-1.9378178", "-1.0322", "-1.381093", "-1.1195827", "0.42083314", "-0.025564995", "1.3968941", "-1.2557675", "-0.10477175", "-3.1901674", "0.16759005", "-1.3643072", "0.98261684", "-1.1048931", "0.7220394", "1.2119225", "-1.4994825", "-0.30802757", "-0.2282143", "0.11086188", "-0.20879354", "-0.7835973", "0.17555691", "-0.88293874", "-1.1185495", "-1.305649", "1.4108386", "-0.0066949064", "-0.4283892", "1.0198814", "0.045026414", "0.44202244", "-0.11295634", "1.6892542", "0.15276997", "1.23057", "-0.84779125", "-0.95530474", "0.6151005", "-0.92381346", "-0.1227941", "0.04217586", "-0.6578717", "-0.7292264", "-0.82307845", "1.6734362", "0.3401897", "1.2390083", "-0.9834985", "0.25667185", "-0.033135485", "1.495299", "0.46577477", "0.30593586", "-0.403756", "-0.61109954", "0.10710977"]}
