Qualitative research, based on analysis of students' written explanations and on face-to-face interviews, exposed three kinds of misunderstanding: 1) that the purpose of engineering models is just to simplify calculations, not to yield usable, reliable results; 2) that a nonlinear problem can be solved using linear concepts; and 3) that the accuracy of a solution is indicated by the number of decimal places in the result, rather than by its closeness to the actual value.\n"}]}, "text": "This paper examines students' achievements in solving problems and their misunderstandings when using models.
