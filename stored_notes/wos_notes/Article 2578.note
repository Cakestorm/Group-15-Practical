Achievement tests, consisting of problems to be solved by using models of a diode and an ideal operational amplifier, were implemented in introductory courses in electronics. Students taught by lecturers whom they rated as having high levels of teaching expertise achieved significantly higher grades on these tests than did students taught by lecturers receiving lower ratings for their teaching expertise.

Qualitative research, based on analysis of students' written explanations and on face-to-face interviews, exposed three kinds of misunderstanding: 1) that the purpose of engineering models is just to simplify calculations, not to yield usable, reliable results; 2) that a nonlinear problem can be solved using linear concepts; and 3) that the accuracy of a solution is indicated by the number of decimal places in the result, rather than by its closeness to the actual value.\n"}]}, "text": "This paper examines students' achievements in solving problems and their misunderstandings when using models.
