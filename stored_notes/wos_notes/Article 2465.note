{"title": "Article 2465", "body": {"ops": [{"insert": "Background: The double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) is considered the definitive diagnostic test for food allergy. Nevertheless, validated recipes for masking the foods are scarce, have not been standardized, and differ between centers. Sensory evaluation techniques such as the triangle test are necessary to validate the recipes used for DBPCFC. Methods: We developed 3 recipes for use in DBPCFC with milk, egg white, and hazelnut and used the triangle test to validate them in a 2-phase study in which 197 volunteers participated. In each phase, participants tried 3 samples (2 active-1 placebo or 2 placebo-1 active) and had to identify the odd one. In phase 1, the 3 samples were given simultaneously, whereas in phase-2, the 3 samples of foods that failed validation in phase 1 were given sequentially. A visual analog scale (VAS) ranging from 1 to 10 was used to evaluate how much participants liked the recipes. Results: In phase 1, the egg white recipe was validated (n=89 volunteers, 38.9% found the odd sample, P=.16). Milk and hazelnut recipes were validated in phase 2 (for both foods, n=30 participants, 36.7% found the odd sample, P=.36). Median VAS scores for the 3 recipes ranged from 6.6 to 9.7. Conclusions: We used sensory testing to validate milk, egg white, and hazelnut recipes for use in DBPCFC. The validated recipes are easy to prepare in a clinical setting, provide the equivalent of 1 serving dose, and were liked by most participants.\n"}]}, "text": "Background: The double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) is considered the definitive diagnostic test for food allergy.
