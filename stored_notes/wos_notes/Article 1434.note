{"title": "Article 1434", "body": "Objective: To quantify cell free fetal DNA (cffDNA) with fetal specific epigenetic marker, hypermethylated RASSF1A, in maternal plasma of normal pregnant women from 20 weeks of gestation and to assess its relationship with maternal age, height, pre-pregnancy weight and body mass index (BMI). Methods: Hundred normal pregnant women within the gestational age of 21-40 weeks were randomly selected and grouped into five (n = 20). Group 1: 21-24, Group 2: 25-28, Group 3: 29-32, Group 4: 33-36 and Group 5: 37-40 weeks. Maternal plasma DNA was extracted, digested with methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme, BstUI and the fetal specific DNA (cffDNA) was quantified by Real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Results: The mean hypermethylated RASSF1A concentrations in different gestational groups were Group 1: 30.1 +/- 14.9, Group 2: 52.6 +/- 22.18, Group 3: 93.2 +/- 19.08, Group 4: 172.8 +/- 26.81 and Group 5: 337.8 +/- 52.9 copies/ml. Pearson's correlation analysis showed highly significant positive correlation between cffDNA and gestational age (r = 0.899, p < 0.001). BMI was also found to be positively related to cffDNA (r = 0.217, p < 0.05). However, it did not show any correlation with maternal age, height and pre-pregnancy weight. Conclusions: The gestational age-dependent increase of hypermethylated RASSF1A; the fetal specific epigenetic marker in maternal plasma was demonstrated, in an Indian study group of normal pregnant women. Findings would form the basis of future studies involving pregnancy complications that would aid in the early diagnosis of placental pathologies with hypermethylated RASSF1A.\n", "text": "Objective: To quantify cell free fetal DNA (cffDNA) with fetal specific epigenetic marker, hypermethylated RASSF1A, in maternal plasma of normal pregnant women from 20 weeks of gestation and to assess its relationship with maternal age, height, pre-pregnancy weight and body mass index (BMI).
