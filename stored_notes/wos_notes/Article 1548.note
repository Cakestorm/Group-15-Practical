Results. Approximately two thirds of the participants (present state 64.29 %; lifetime 69.57 %) suffered from a psychiatric disorder classifiable with ICD-10. Posttraumatic stress disorder (25.16 %), conduct disorders (21.34%) and attention and hyperactivity disorders (16.15 %) were most frequently diagnosed.

To improve access to appropriate services for this vulnerable clientele, cooperation between psychiatrists and psychotherapists and the child welfare system is essential. The implementation and dissemination of evidence-based diagnostic methods and treatments must be further advanced.\n"}]}, "text": "Background.
