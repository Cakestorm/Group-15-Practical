{"title": "Article 1548", "body": "Background. Child abuse and neglect (CAN) is a risk factor for the development of psychiatric disorders. Untreated, disorders can sustain into adulthood. Objectives. This study compares rates of psychiatric disorders to mental health care utilization in victims of CAN. Methods. From three regions in Germany, 322 children and adolescents aged between 4 and 17 and a non-abusive caregiver were assessed for the child's history of CAN, mental health and mental health care utilization via semi-structured interviews. Results. Approximately two thirds of the participants (present state 64.29 %; lifetime 69.57 %) suffered from a psychiatric disorder classifiable with ICD-10. Posttraumatic stress disorder (25.16 %), conduct disorders (21.34%) and attention and hyperactivity disorders (16.15 %) were most frequently diagnosed. Merely 19.88% were using mental health care at the time of the assessment. Conclusions. The provision of mental health care for victims of CAN is insufficient. To improve access to appropriate services for this vulnerable clientele, cooperation between psychiatrists and psychotherapists and the child welfare system is essential. The implementation and dissemination of evidence-based diagnostic methods and treatments must be further advanced.\n", "text": "Background.
