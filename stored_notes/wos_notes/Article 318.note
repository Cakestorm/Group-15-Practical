{"title": "Article 318", "body": "The objective of this study was to assess the sensitivity of the Omni Klentaq-LA DNA polymerase for detecting Aleutian mink disease virus (AMDV) in mink blood and tissues by PCR without DNA extraction. The presence of AMDV DNA was directly tested by Klentaq in the plasma, serum, whole blood, and spleen homogenates of 188 mink 4 and 16 months after inoculation with the virus. Samples from bone marrow, small intestine, liver, lungs, kidneys, and lymph nodes of 20 of the same mink were also tested by Klentaq. DNA was extracted from paired samples of plasma and the aforesaid tissues by a commercial nucleic acid extraction kit (Dynabeads Silane) and tested by PCR. Compared with the extracted DNA, Klentaq detected a significantly greater number of samples in the whole blood, serum, plasma, spleen, and small intestine. It was concluded that Klentaq is a preferred system for directly detecting AMDV DNA in mink blood and tissues. The lower success rate of extracted DNA compared with Klentaq could be the result of DNA losses during the extraction process. This is an important factor in chronically infected mink, which have a low AMDV copy number in the bloodstream. Direct AMDV detection also reduces the cost of PCR amplification and lowers the risk of sample contamination.\n", "text": "The objective of this study was to assess the sensitivity of the Omni Klentaq-LA DNA polymerase for detecting Aleutian mink disease virus (AMDV) in mink blood and tissues by PCR without DNA extraction.
