{"title": "Article 1972", "body": {"ops": [{"insert": "Recently early diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCCA) as a tumor maker of various cancers has increasingly attracted a lot of attention with heightening of incidence rate of cancer. The SCCA with low concentration in human serum should be diluted before detecting. Thus, an immunoassay with high sensitivity is significant for early detecting SCCA. Therefore, a nonenzymatic sandwich-type electrochemical immunosensor herein was conducted to quantitative detection of squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCCA). The amino functionalized cobaltosic oxide @ ceric dioxide nanocubes with core-shell morphology were prepared to combine sea-urchin like gold @ platinum nanoparticles (Co3O4@CeO2-Au@Pt), and used as labels to conjugate with secondary antibodies for signal amplification. Due to the synergetic effect, excellent electrochemical property and superior auxiliary catalytic activity of Co3O4@CeO2-Au@Pt, high electrocatalytic current responses toward the reduction of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) were achieved. Besides, the electrodeposited gold nanoparticles (D-Au NPs) which were modified on glassy carbon electrodes (GCE) were used as antibodies carriers and sensing platforms. With the well cooperation of Co3O4@CeO2-Au@Pt and D-Au NPs, a broad linear range from 100 fg/mL to 80 ng/mL with a low detection limit of 33 fg/mL for detecting SCCA was achieved. In addition, the immunosensor displayed with good reproducibility, high selectivity and stability. The results are satisfactory when the proposed method has been applied to analyze human serum samples, indicating that the potential application is promising in clinical monitoring of tumor markers.\n"}]}, "text": "Recently early diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCCA) as a tumor maker of various cancers has increasingly attracted a lot of attention with heightening of incidence rate of cancer.
