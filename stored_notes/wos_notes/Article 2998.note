Protocadherin 7 expression was decreased gradiently from normal tissue to gastric cancer, especially in gastric cancer tissue with lymph node metastasis. Low expression of protocadherin 7 was significantly associated with Lauren's classification (p = 0.0005), lymph node metastases (p = 0.0002), and tumor node metastasis stage (p = 0.0221), as well as poor prognosis (p < 0.05). Furthermore, down-regulation of protocadherin 7 in gastric cancer cell lines significantly increased their migration and invasion abilities (both p0.05). Additionally, our results demonstrated that E-cadherin expression was down-regulated in gastric cancer cells with protocadherin 7 depletion. Our data indicated that protocadherin 7 may play important roles in the invasion and metastasis of gastric cancer, and protocadherin 7 could suppress cell migration and invasion through E-cadherin inhibition.
