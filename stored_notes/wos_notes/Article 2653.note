{"title": "Article 2653", "body": "IntroductionWomen with polycystic ovary syndrome have a three-fold higher risk of endometrial cancer. Insulin resistance and hyperlipidemia may be pertinent factors in the pathogenesis of both conditions. The aim of this study was to investigate endometrial sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 gene expression in polycystic ovary syndrome and endometrial cancer endometrium, and to correlate endometrial sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 gene expression with serum lipid profiles. Material and methodsA cross-sectional study was performed at Nottingham University Hospital, UK. A total of 102 women (polycystic ovary syndrome, endometrial cancer and controls; 34 participants in each group) were recruited. Clinical and biochemical assessments were performed before endometrial biopsies were obtained from all participants. Taqman real-time polymerase chain reaction for endometrial sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 gene and its systemic protein expression were analyzed. ResultsThe body mass indices of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (29.282.91kg/m(2)) and controls (28.58 +/- 2.62kg/m(2)) were not significantly different. Women with endometrial cancer had a higher mean body mass index (32.22 +/- 5.70kg/m(2)). Sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 gene expression was significantly increased in polycystic ovary syndrome and endometrial cancer endometrium compared with controls (p<0.0001). Sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 gene expression was positively correlated with body mass index (r=0.017, p=0.921) and waist-hip ratio (r=0.023, p=0.544) in polycystic ovary syndrome, but this was not statistically significant. Similarly, statistically insignificant positive correlations were found between endometrial sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 gene expression and body mass index in endometrial cancer (r=0.643, p=0.06) and waist-hip ratio (r=0.096, p=0.073). Sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 gene expression was significantly positively correlated with triglyceride in both polycystic ovary syndrome and endometrial cancer (p=0.028 and p=0.027, respectively). Quantitative serum sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 gene correlated with endometrial gene expression (p<0.05). ConclusionsSterol regulatory element binding protein-1 gene expression is significantly increased in the endometrium of women with polycystic ovary syndrome and women with endometrial cancer compared with controls and positively correlates with serum triglyceride in both polycystic ovary syndrome and endometrial cancer.\n", "text": "IntroductionWomen with polycystic ovary syndrome have a three-fold higher risk of endometrial cancer.
