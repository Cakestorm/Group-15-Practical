{"title": "Article 341", "body": "Background: Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) capsule enables evasion from phagocytosis, invasion of keratinocytes, and bacterial survival. In mixed infection, the capsule also participates in coaggregation, which may lead to characteristic virulence not present in the monoinfection. The aim of this study is to evaluate the role of Pg capsule as a virulence factor in coaggregated mixed infection with Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn). Methods: Mixed infections containing Fn and non-capsulated or capsulated strains of Pg were compared with the same infection with lactose as coaggregation inhibitor. Murine experimental periodontitis was used to assess disease severity. Primary polymorphonuclear leukocytes and keratinocytes were used to examine phagocytosis and bacterial invasion, respectively. Results: Mixed infection with capsulated Pg augmented alveolar bone loss compared with that of mixed infection with non-capsulated Pg. Addition of lactose led to attenuation of bone loss in the capsulated mixed infection and to intensification of bone loss in the non-capsulated mixed infection. In the latter mixed infection, Fn evaded phagocytosis, whereas in the capsulated mixed infection Pg displayed a greater capacity for invasion of keratinocytes. Conclusions: Pg capsule was found to serve as a unique virulence factor in mixed infection with Fn. Capsule-dependent coaggregation led to augmented invasion of Pg and may be responsible for the severity of disease after mixed infection with Fn.\n", "text": "Background: Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) capsule enables evasion from phagocytosis, invasion of keratinocytes, and bacterial survival.
