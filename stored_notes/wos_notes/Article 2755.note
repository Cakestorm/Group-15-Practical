{"title": "Article 2755", "body": {"ops": [{"insert": "Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) is closely involved in the degradation of extracellular matrix and confers invasive and metastatic potential to malignant tumors. MMP-2 is a type-IV collagenase secreted as a proenzyme that is activated on the surface of the tumor cell by membrane-type I MMP (MT1-MMP). MT1-MMP plays a critical role during tumor progression and metastasis. We investigated the expression levels of E1AF and MT1-MMP in malignant melanoma cell lines and specimens from patients in order to clarify the mechanisms responsible for the invasion and metastasis of malignant melanoma. High levels of E1AF and MT1-MMP mRNA expression were observed in melanoma cells by Northern blotting and real-time PCR. The expression level was highly correlated with an invasive potential determined by an in vitro invasion assay. The down-regulation of MT1-MMP was identified when E1AF was knocked down by RNA interference.
