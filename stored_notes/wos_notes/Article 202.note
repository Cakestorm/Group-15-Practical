Methods: The cross-sectional field study was conducted in Kocaeli, Turkey, and comprised high-school students during the 2014-15 school years. Data was collected using the Information Collection Form, Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and Shortened Level of Expressed Emotion Scale. SPSS 21 was used for data analysis. Results: Of the 487 subjects, 295(60.57%) were girls and 192(39.43%) were boys. The overall median age was 16 (inter-quartile range: 15-17 years). There were significant positive relationships between the scales in terms of emotional problems (p<0.001), behavioural problems (p<0.001), Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (p<0.001), and peer relationship problems (p<0.001). There was also a negative significant relationship between pro-social behaviours and expressed emotion (p<0.001). Conclusion: The concept of perceived expressed emotion in non-clinical adolescents is useful in alarming clinicians and preventing mental disorders.\n"}]}, "text": "Objective: To investigate the association between the perception of expressed emotion and psychopathology of school-going adolescents in a non-clinical sample.
