{"body": "Objectives: To develop and provide validity evidence for a performance checklist to evaluate the child abuse screening behaviors of prehospital providers. Methods: Checklist Development: We developed the first iteration of the checklist after review of the relevant literature and on the basis of the authors' clinical experience. Next, a panel of six content experts participated in three rounds of Delphi review to reach consensus on the final checklist items. Checklist Validation: Twenty-eight emergency medical services (EMS) providers (16 EMT-Basics, 12 EMT-Paramedics) participated in a standardized simulated case of physical child abuse to an infant followed by one-on-one semi-structured qualitative interviews. Three reviewers scored the videotaped performance using the final checklist. Light's kappa and Cronbach's alpha were calculated to assess inter-rater reliability (IRR) and internal consistency, respectively. The correlation of successful child abuse screening with checklist task completion and with participant characteristics were compared using Pearson's chi squared test to gather evidence for construct validity. Results: The Delphi review process resulted in a final checklist that included 24 items classified with trichotomous scoring (done, not done, or not applicable). The overall IRR of the three raters was 0.70 using Light's kappa, indicating substantial agreement. Internal consistency of the checklist was low, with an overall Cronbach's alpha of 0.61. Of 28 participants, only 14 (50%) successfully screened for child abuse in simulation. Participants who successfully screened for child abuse did not differ significantly from those who failed to screen in terms of training level, past experience with child abuse reporting, or self-reported confidence in detecting child abuse (all p >0.30). Of all 24 tasks, only the task of exposing the infant significantly correlated with successful detection of child abuse (p < 0.05). Conclusions: We developed a child abuse checklist that demonstrated strong content validity and substantial inter-rater reliability, but successful item completion did not correlate with other markers of provider experience. The validated instrument has important potential for training, continuing education, and research for prehospital providers at all levels of training.\n", "embeddings": ["0.41335353", "-0.8997265", "-0.5689759", "-1.0327284", "1.3559226", "1.6136643", "-0.18672672", "2.386031", "-1.5702312", "0.41100708", "-1.4858452", "-0.27407077", "0.34382355", "0.3151061", "-3.1216762", "0.86019653", "1.3674761", "1.5411581", "-0.5257635", "-0.32813707", "-0.1637927", "-2.5262191", "-0.7969956", "0.96903926", "0.23609948", "0.54080856", "0.7763802", "1.8066945", "1.379681", "-1.4379106", "0.08889065", "0.19525693", "2.0857143", "2.0020733", "-1.0167897", "-0.5343798", "-0.29456195", "-0.111115895", "0.93032616", "1.7004806", "-2.0673358", "0.6977586", "1.865183", "-1.0341446", "-0.41489893", "-2.5313435", "-0.21830624", "1.8892999", "0.29591122", "2.6083765", "1.3489234", "-0.7924164", "-0.10209181", "0.92588073", "-1.7646012", "2.30846", "-0.10776026", "0.0799125", "1.2092092", "0.093733735", "-0.71850854", "0.25625673", "-0.32839382", "-0.6252276", "-1.0956523", "1.0325873", "-1.033089", "1.3663495", "-0.21004112", "1.0909344", "0.54282224", "-1.3131061", "-0.6122754", "0.19769362", "0.32234883", "0.053917352", "-1.6901137", "-0.12245562", "-0.97489053", "1.5298384", "-0.99877965", "-3.1732643", "-0.40178168", "-0.9003834", "-1.6192212", "1.3797451", "-0.33432472", "0.11017145", "0.34051874", "-0.31497315", "-0.8383712", "0.6130479", "1.4245796", "1.9093459", "0.08258", "-0.59068257", "0.05447761", "-0.13495792", "0.44275585", "-0.20219097", "0.95363253", "-0.34470004", "0.5151749", "1.5178449", "-1.9281819", "-3.9871628", "1.2487766", "2.4267848", "-1.9386489", "0.16807209", "-0.671979", "-3.093827", "0.6183995", "1.513724", "0.3699646", "-0.8323071", "1.4262408", "1.028929", "0.7972907", "-0.2369359", "1.1010574", "-0.72414815", "-1.3824389", "-0.26483157", "1.0437663", "1.5847687", "-0.8342232", "-0.532795", "-0.5658373", "1.6495957", "-0.26398933", "-1.7116994", "0.36829644", "-0.7736981", "0.1325844", "-0.6263671", "-0.13328117", "0.068014294", "-1.722209", "1.9955252", "0.21721432", "0.66491216", "-1.1205583", "0.33829814", "-1.934182", "0.4549316", "-1.9618558", "0.84565526", "-0.86982214", "0.84903955", "-0.46247464", "-0.84217036", "-0.03621906", "-2.6065226", "-2.2923675", "1.6995752", "0.5994506", "-0.9043039", "0.44444168", "-0.08911643", "-2.6319048", "0.27348688", "1.7531437", "0.42410251", "1.6637481", "1.0630296", "0.7000965", "-0.48036164", "-0.7867525", "1.4059721", "0.47894955", "-0.5345015", "0.444647", "0.16898412", "-0.11046515", "-0.9781643", "-0.17786577", "-0.13415098", "0.59813774", "-0.6205116", "-0.1400263", "1.4128306", "-0.8680974", "1.4437008", "-0.27808657", "-1.4670395", "-0.19985706", "-0.018267127", "1.0812635", "-1.4089807", "1.7881469", "0.36347497", "0.09310297", "-0.49375397", "0.6299202", "2.301716", "0.6573955", "-0.19208147", "-1.0002944", "0.81468475"]}
