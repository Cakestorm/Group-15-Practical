Instead of a high accuracy OPA-based current sensor, this paper describes using a switching inductor quasi-V-2 hysteretic control boost dc-dc regulator with a proposed current-sensing technique named emulated-ramp feedback (ERF), which can improve transfer efficiency under a full load range. Two control systems are presented in this paper. The first system, a hysteretic voltage control switching boost converter with ERF, achieves the hysteretic voltage control in a boost regulator and lowers the cost characteristic without using compensator. The second system, a quasi-V-2 hysteretic voltage control switching boost converter with ERF, demonstrates the compatibility of ERF technique in rippled-based control boost converters.
