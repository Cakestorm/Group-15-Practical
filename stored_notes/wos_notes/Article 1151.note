This review provides an introduction and overview of the papers in this special edition on social cognition and places these in the context of other recent research.

Issues in how social cognition are assessed are discussed, including the importance of context to social cognition, its interactive nature and the need to recognise influences such as family upbringing, gender and emotional state on social cognitive performance.

Interventions are especially well developed in relation to schizophrenia, and less well developed in brain injury.
