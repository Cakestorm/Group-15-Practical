{"title": "Article 2897", "body": "This paper presents a novel CMOS folded cascode operational amplifier that leads to high PSRR and provides gain nearly equal to that of a two stage op-amp. The proposed design is implemented in GPDK 0.18 m CMOS technology. This op amp uses a folded cascode structure in the output stage combined with the differential amplifier having PMOS input transistors to achieve good input common mode range and lower flicker noise. It has an important feature that it allows the input common mode level close to supply voltage. The proposed topology improves the PSRR of op-amp which can be used for LDO applications. Simulations using Cadence under 1.8 V show a DC gain of 72.0404 dB and a phase margin of 62.4636 degree at a unity gain bandwidth of 13.33 MHz with the power consumption smaller than 0.13 mW along with a PSRR of 72.0966 dB. The layout of the design shows that the area acquired on the chip is approximately equal to 8897.27 mu m(2).\n", "text": "This paper presents a novel CMOS folded cascode operational amplifier that leads to high PSRR and provides gain nearly equal to that of a two stage op-amp.
