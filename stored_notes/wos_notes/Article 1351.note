{"body": "While the US Food and Drug Administration has not approved the use of 3% papain gel in the United States, the authors feel this study adds to the literature regarding its use. Introduction. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of 3% papain gel on wounds in mice. Materials and Methods. Thirty healthy C57BL mice (25-30 g) aged 10 weeks were randomly divided into 2 groups: mice treated with 3% papain gel and mice treated with placebo gel. Skin incisions were performed with a 6-mm metallic punch with a cutting blade edge. On days 3 and 7 after creating the lesion, the mice were euthanized and lesion samples were collected. The lesion samples were processed and sectioned into 3 fragments of skin to be stained with 3 types of dye: hematoxylin and eosin, Picrosirius red, and Weigert. In addition, immunohistochemical analysis (alpha-SM actin and Ki67) followed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocol was performed on the samples. Results. On gross examination, the 3% papain-treated group took less time to heal the wounds compared with the control. On day 7, microscopic examination showed the 3% papain-treated group had lower numbers of inflammatory cells, increased neovascularization, and improved organization of collagen and elastic fibers. Using PCR analysis, the 3% papain-treated group showed a significant increase in transforming growth factor beta and interleukin-6 expression compared with the control (P < .05). Conclusion. Due to a reduced local inflammatory response, increased angiogenesis, and improved organization of collagen deposition, these findings demonstrate 3% papain gel can improve cutaneous wound healing in mice.\n", "embeddings": ["1.2058086", "-1.6230568", "1.1099267", "-1.9783806", "1.7978628", "-1.3665091", "-0.66509247", "1.1879137", "-1.0722845", "-0.20738827", "-0.5728472", "-0.52135074", "-0.096992746", "1.1356888", "-0.7421295", "-0.35240698", "-2.7254932", "1.5940007", "0.92135894", "-2.9724288", "-0.91330993", "1.6161447", "-0.07149659", "0.8218099", "-1.018359", "-2.1564217", "0.34810454", "0.57698435", "-2.2976978", "-0.8544002", "1.570594", "-0.8959351", "2.4386075", "0.5953383", "-0.88078976", "-0.2315809", "2.2289176", "0.9553926", "0.37867576", "0.49040228", "-0.3543702", "-0.3818652", "0.4785504", "0.8420975", "0.39690733", "-0.06944589", "-0.4819388", "0.21995626", "1.0832816", "-1.3758708", "0.9544642", "0.082741365", "-1.0418853", "-1.4313267", "0.056049127", "-0.82040566", "-1.1596432", "-0.84149605", "0.35782707", "-0.7497124", "1.2651259", "-0.5195283", "0.7451254", "-0.34767106", "-0.70307255", "0.8499242", "1.4399537", "0.33188254", "-1.8021849", "-0.37331516", "0.91924226", "-0.25974333", "-0.74884164", "0.15597755", "-0.28570566", "0.6222521", "1.2489157", "0.8111851", "0.037609823", "1.013147", "0.18800166", "-1.4465948", "-1.3272586", "0.21581301", "-0.118218325", "-0.50109243", "0.39676538", "-0.1436281", "-1.0354741", "-0.13644464", "1.000313", "1.040421", "-0.9365938", "1.2039886", "0.09629409", "0.49173966", "-0.79389125", "-0.8706615", "0.5390518", "-0.4612731", "0.39161903", "0.66515493", "-0.27409303", "-0.3224711", "-2.721537", "0.53614026", "0.5564205", "2.6048265", "-0.46688882", "-1.854671", "1.5236259", "-0.09290718", "-1.3036988", "0.23068152", "1.4097", "-0.013995873", "0.2533664", "-0.7356337", "0.62979704", "-1.8778596", "-0.5635775", "1.7655038", "-0.34716126", "-0.7290754", "1.8333303", "-0.7252978", "0.22290765", "-1.3255645", "0.9343405", "0.9093055", "1.1910063", "0.20320496", "-0.44291016", "0.113409385", "-0.33957732", "0.40380886", "-1.317989", "0.12698968", "-0.31250235", "-0.1945996", "0.81606716", "0.22376035", "-1.424542", "-0.41931805", "0.13499142", "0.043928403", "-0.03999251", "-1.5994542", "-0.3240356", "0.7066098", "0.7217281", "1.2377166", "-1.0518037", "0.6718567", "-1.0333827", "0.3489215", "1.0795604", "0.39300293", "0.46906787", "0.025777232", "0.74153805", "1.231389", "-0.7124605", "-0.111776546", "0.38215762", "0.76105326", "0.8112989", "-0.06715284", "-0.5381936", "0.14158426", "-1.710014", "0.53400505", "-0.7094952", "0.9031242", "0.68669754", "0.056692716", "-0.65793055", "0.111725084", "-1.4133759", "-0.0032799952", "1.1486155", "1.2932531", "0.2262367", "0.597427", "-0.27195585", "0.5286386", "-1.9515814", "0.886352", "0.98011994", "-0.36585608", "1.3469528", "0.35228902", "0.3997974", "-0.38332376", "-0.73374075", "-1.0000542", "-0.2615432", "1.0119984", "1.5189985", "-0.041596822"]}
