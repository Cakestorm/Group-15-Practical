The SOD activity of ThCSD was inactivated by potassium cyanide and hydrogen peroxide but not by sodium azide, confirming that ThCSD is a Cu/Zn-SOD. Northern blotting demonstrated that ThCSD is expressed in roots, stems, and leaves. ThCSD mRNA levels increased by about 30-fold when plants were treated with sodium chloride (NaCl), abscisic acid (ABA), and indole-acetic acid (IAA) and by about 50-fold when treated with UVB light. These results indicate that ThCSD is involved in physiological pathways activated by a variety of environmental conditions.\n"}]}, "text": "Superoxide dismutases (SODs) constitute the first line of cellular defense against oxidative stress in plants.
