Sequence analysis indicated that the ThCSD gene (GenBank accession number EF405867) had an open reading frame of 456 bp.

Recombinant ThCSD protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and assayed for SOD enzymatic activity in a native polyacrylamide gel. The SOD activity of ThCSD was inactivated by potassium cyanide and hydrogen peroxide but not by sodium azide, confirming that ThCSD is a Cu/Zn-SOD. Northern blotting demonstrated that ThCSD is expressed in roots, stems, and leaves. ThCSD mRNA levels increased by about 30-fold when plants were treated with sodium chloride (NaCl), abscisic acid (ABA), and indole-acetic acid (IAA) and by about 50-fold when treated with UVB light. These results indicate that ThCSD is involved in physiological pathways activated by a variety of environmental conditions.\n"}]}, "text": "Superoxide dismutases (SODs) constitute the first line of cellular defense against oxidative stress in plants.
