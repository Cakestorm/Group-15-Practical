{"title": "Article 2789", "body": "Superoxide dismutases (SODs) constitute the first line of cellular defense against oxidative stress in plants. SODs generally occur in three different forms with Cu/Zn, Fe, or Mn as prosthetic metals. We cloned the full-length cDNA of the Thellungiella halophila Cu/Zn-SOD gene ThCSD using degenerate RT-PCR and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). Sequence analysis indicated that the ThCSD gene (GenBank accession number EF405867) had an open reading frame of 456 bp. The deduced 152-amino acid polypeptide had a predicted molecular weight of 15.1 kDa, an estimated pI of 5.4, and a putative Cu/Zn-binding site. Recombinant ThCSD protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and assayed for SOD enzymatic activity in a native polyacrylamide gel. The SOD activity of ThCSD was inactivated by potassium cyanide and hydrogen peroxide but not by sodium azide, confirming that ThCSD is a Cu/Zn-SOD. Northern blotting demonstrated that ThCSD is expressed in roots, stems, and leaves. ThCSD mRNA levels increased by about 30-fold when plants were treated with sodium chloride (NaCl), abscisic acid (ABA), and indole-acetic acid (IAA) and by about 50-fold when treated with UVB light. These results indicate that ThCSD is involved in physiological pathways activated by a variety of environmental conditions.\n", "text": "Superoxide dismutases (SODs) constitute the first line of cellular defense against oxidative stress in plants.
