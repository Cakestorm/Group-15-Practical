{"body": "According to the Brazilian Association of Organ Transplants, in 2015, 19,408 bone transplants were performed in Brazil, over 90% by Dental Surgeons. The surgical technique itself has a respectable number of reports regarding its clinical efficacy, as measured by long-term survival of dental implants in grafted areas. Uncertainty remains, however, as to whether fresh frozen grafts from human bone donors remain immunologically innocuous in the body of the host. Six male with no previous medical history of note, including systemic diseases, surgery or blood transfusion were selected. These patients underwent reconstructive procedures (sinus lifting) using fresh frozen human bone from a tissue bank. All patients had venous blood samples collected prior to surgery and 6 months after the procedure. Anti-HLA analysis for the detection of HLA(human leukocyte antigen) antibodies was performed using methods such as the LAB Screen PRA Class I and Class II, LAB Screen Single Antigen Class I and Class II, Luminex Platform. Reactive individuals to the screening tests (LAB Screen PRA) were further investigated to determine the specificity of the antibodies detected (LAB Screen Single Antigen) with a cutoff value of median fluorescence intensity >= 500. As a result, it was observed that two patients (33%) were positive in screening tests, one presenting with anti-HLA Class I and II sensitization and the other with anti-HLA class II. The specificity analysis showed that the patients sensitized to HLA class II presented 4 specificities, 3 of which immunologically relevant. In the second individual, 23 specificities were identified, 6 of which immunologically important for HLA class I and 4 specificities for HLA class II, 3 of these were immunologically important. All specificities detected had average fluorescence. These findings are suggestive that sinus-lifting procedures with allogeneic bone can induce immunological sensitization.\n", "embeddings": ["1.3486706", "-0.7495218", "-1.2096571", "0.18707022", "2.2545443", "0.00571678", "-0.019482845", "0.88969415", "-1.00779", "-0.39611003", "-1.8921221", "-0.16102542", "1.5464137", "-0.11770692", "-0.0389211", "-2.3644426", "0.07900148", "-1.3002112", "0.7285459", "-1.3054082", "0.26068738", "-1.8907356", "1.9233644", "1.3406751", "-0.329863", "-0.7877989", "-0.59353167", "-0.46099082", "1.0292332", "-0.68019396", "1.7704703", "1.5901357", "2.2643473", "0.63927835", "1.1359177", "-0.6191373", "0.9662202", "-1.2566352", "-0.052324634", "0.46489817", "-0.21915734", "0.57951206", "0.41215402", "-1.219833", "2.0710995", "-0.15767094", "-1.1803296", "-0.39915136", "-0.6659527", "0.013861584", "2.0694995", "0.34202456", "0.5480315", "-0.09165457", "-2.4485896", "0.15930785", "-0.2964018", "-1.4974519", "0.9906188", "-0.8320812", "-0.12896259", "1.1655699", "-0.49756503", "0.2776305", "-0.44561318", "0.50656605", "2.5187032", "1.07207", "0.8533972", "1.5410976", "0.6781761", "1.6279713", "-1.0724154", "-0.026885593", "0.76033646", "0.46047378", "-1.1933082", "-0.327968", "-1.4235294", "0.038056273", "-0.096212335", "0.14053422", "0.117977925", "1.0664982", "-0.3468504", "-0.9396883", "-1.859717", "-1.8963511", "-0.5747557", "-0.7688846", "-0.86840796", "-0.32589477", "0.76213926", "-1.6959819", "0.52101046", "-1.2413502", "-0.7114755", "1.1880656", "-0.6149913", "0.45008424", "0.97252387", "-0.7589772", "0.310521", "-0.069282025", "0.18046676", "-1.1804333", "-0.76375115", "1.1477774", "-2.8597515", "-0.027814534", "-0.09816316", "0.21602856", "-0.044395033", "-1.4954854", "0.6409512", "-1.7093105", "0.13305293", "0.3917191", "0.24397084", "-1.0872917", "0.621842", "0.59326214", "0.37279537", "0.18124004", "0.88497746", "-0.5081871", "1.9069378", "1.1355764", "-0.21321774", "-1.1048424", "1.3803267", "0.85774565", "1.199913", "0.22792631", "0.76494", "0.99027884", "1.0101463", "0.25269163", "0.7239898", "0.00069735147", "-1.1704243", "1.3040115", "-2.0225732", "-0.2977988", "-0.6303591", "0.8064259", "0.9440487", "0.32341492", "0.9522867", "-1.4980897", "0.83926344", "-0.3427704", "-0.9143175", "0.35811234", "-0.7578705", "0.22663938", "-0.67121834", "1.4237579", "-0.036976602", "-0.70854056", "0.59183484", "0.9350708", "0.7839528", "0.26772785", "-0.9979034", "-0.16750517", "0.25322655", "-0.8303084", "-1.2162763", "-0.38972196", "-0.11756533", "0.36603332", "1.5819618", "-0.2592078", "0.5288056", "0.77041805", "-0.11308733", "-0.18277662", "0.9396698", "-1.5631429", "-0.565903", "0.8004188", "-0.79439735", "0.8441957", "-0.48284036", "-2.1129043", "-0.7962918", "0.3830366", "2.0903943", "1.4722595", "1.700849", "-0.6417627", "-0.27898678", "-0.30467948", "1.3680072", "1.4706", "-0.5701233", "-0.50573796", "-0.7963626", "-1.4199778"]}
