All patients had venous blood samples collected prior to surgery and 6 months after the procedure. Anti-HLA analysis for the detection of HLA(human leukocyte antigen) antibodies was performed using methods such as the LAB Screen PRA Class I and Class II, LAB Screen Single Antigen Class I and Class II, Luminex Platform. Reactive individuals to the screening tests (LAB Screen PRA) were further investigated to determine the specificity of the antibodies detected (LAB Screen Single Antigen) with a cutoff value of median fluorescence intensity >= 500. As a result, it was observed that two patients (33%) were positive in screening tests, one presenting with anti-HLA Class I and II sensitization and the other with anti-HLA class II. The specificity analysis showed that the patients sensitized to HLA class II presented 4 specificities, 3 of which immunologically relevant. In the second individual, 23 specificities were identified, 6 of which immunologically important for HLA class I and 4 specificities for HLA class II, 3 of these were immunologically important. All specificities detected had average fluorescence. These findings are suggestive that sinus-lifting procedures with allogeneic bone can induce immunological sensitization.\n"}]}, "text": "According to the Brazilian Association of Organ Transplants, in 2015, 19,408 bone transplants were performed in Brazil, over 90% by Dental Surgeons.
