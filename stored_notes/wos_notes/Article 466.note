{"title": "Article 466", "body": "The work proposes an improved technique to design a low power 8-bit asynchronous successive approximation register (ASAR), an analog-to-digital converter (ADC). The proposed ASAR ADC consists of a comparator, ASAR (digital control logic block), and a capacitivedigital-to-analog convertor (C-DAC). The comparator is a preamplier-based improved positive feedback latch circuit which has a built-in sample and hold (S/H) functionality and saves an enormous amount of power. The implemented digital control logic block performing the successive approximation (SA) algorithm is totally unrestrained of the external clock pulse. The outputs from the comparator are given to a XOR logic whose outputs serve as an internally generated clock (ready signal) to trigger the digital control block. Hence, an external clock is not required to initiate the digital control block making its operation asynchronous. By implementing this, the ADC can circumvent the usage of an oversampled clock and can operate on a single low-speed sample clock. This, in turn, saves power and it cuts down the required resilience in sampling rates. The proposed ADC has been designed and simulated using UMC-0.18 mu m CMOS technology which dissipates 32.18 mu W power when operated on a single 1V power supply and achieves complete 8-bit conversion in 1.09 mu s. The relative accuracy of capacitor ratio, aperture jitter and FOM are 0.39%, 1.2 ns and 125 fJ/conversion-step, respectively.\n", "text": "The work proposes an improved technique to design a low power 8-bit asynchronous successive approximation register (ASAR), an analog-to-digital converter (ADC).
