{"title": "Article 142", "body": "RNA-sequencing of the patient's bone marrow detected fusion transcripts in which the coding sequence of the FAM53B gene (from 10q26) was fused to a genomic sequence (from 19q13) that mapped upstream of the SLC7A10 locus. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction together with Sanger sequencing verified the presence of this fusion transcript. The FAM53B fusion transcript is not expected to produce any chimeric protein. However, it may code for a truncated FAM53B protein consisting of the first 302 amino acids of FAM53B together with amino acids from the 19q13 sequence. Functionally, the truncated FAM53B would be similar to the protein encoded by the FAM53B sequence with accession no. BC031654.1 (FAM53B protein accession no. AAH31654.1). Furthermore, the truncated protein contains the entire conserved domain of the FAM53 protein family. The chromosome aberration t(10;19)(q26;q13) detected in this study was previously reported in a single case of ALL, in which it was also the sole karyotypic change. Both patients entered complete hematological and cytogenetic remission following treatment.\n", "text": "RNA-sequencing of the patient's bone marrow detected fusion transcripts in which the coding sequence of the FAM53B gene (from 10q26) was fused to a genomic sequence (from 19q13) that mapped upstream of the SLC7A10 locus.
