{"title": "Article 211", "body": "Social network sites (SNSs) are relatively new phenomena, and the relationship between SNSs and psychopathology remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the type of SNSs depressed adolescents use and the incidence of depressive disclosure on SNSs among them. The study was designed to be cross-sectional. The sample consisted of 53 adolescents diagnosed with depressive disorder, as confirmed by K-SADS-PL, and 55 non-depressed adolescents. The Children's Depression Inventory, Social Anxiety Scale and Social Network Use Questionnaire were administered. The primary finding was that the amount of time spent on the Internet and on SNSs was significantly higher among depressed adolescents than non-depressed adolescents. Additionally, depressed adolescents reported significantly higher disclosure of anhedonia, worthlessness, guilt, loss of concentration, irritability and thoughts of suicide on SNSs. The intensity of the depression sharing was significantly higher in the depressed group. Depressed young people use social networks to express their symptoms. Adolescents' disclosure on social networks may be able to guide relatives, friends and mental health professionals.\n", "text": "Social network sites (SNSs) are relatively new phenomena, and the relationship between SNSs and psychopathology remains unclear.
