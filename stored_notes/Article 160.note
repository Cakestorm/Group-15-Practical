{"title": "Article 160", "body": "This paper proposes a dimmable energy-efficient light-emitting diode (LED) driver for applications in interior lighting. High efficiency is achieved by an adaptive voltage regulation, which minimizes power losses in the linear current regulator. A digital control mechanism employing a resistive digital-to-analog converter for feeding the analog feedback input of a dc-dc converter is introduced. It is shown that the digital control methodology gives maximum design flexibility and enhances control over regulation speed and stability. In an experimental setup, the proposed concept is verified and evaluated. Operating at an input voltage of 24 V, the LED driver provides a relatively wide output voltage range of 3.5-38 V. Output current is regulated to 700 mA with a steady-state precision of more than 98.8%, whereas pulsewidth modulation dimming with a frequency of 1 kHz and shortest on-time of 4 mu s is employed. A peak efficiency of the complete system of 93.9% is achieved.\n", "text": "This paper proposes a dimmable energy-efficient light-emitting diode (LED) driver for applications in interior lighting.
