The enhancement in the TE properties is attributed to the synergetic effect of high charge mobility by the acid treatment and the optimal oxidation level tuned by the base treatment.\n"}]}, "text": "Thermoelectric (TE) materials are important for the sustainable development because they enable the direct harvesting of low-quality heat into electricity.
