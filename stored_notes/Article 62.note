{"title": "Article 62", "body": "Purpose of review This review addresses some of the more salient articles in the field of child maltreatment published in 2015, with a goal of helping the general practitioner understand the evolution of research in the field of child abuse pediatrics (a board-certified specialty since 2009). Recent findings Researchers continue to refine the database for child abuse pediatrics. Several articles focus on the inconsistencies in approach to the evaluation of possible physical child abuse between hospitals and practitioners. Multiple researchers aim to develop a protocol that standardizes the response to findings of a sentinel injury, such as a rib fracture, abdominal trauma, or unexplained bruising in a nonambulatory infant. Professionals are also working to improve our understanding about the impact of trauma on children and how best to ameliorate its effects. Summary With solid, evidence-based literature published on various topics in the field of child abuse pediatrics, experts work to refine and unify the clinician's approach to the evaluation of possible physical abuse.\n", "text": "Purpose of review This review addresses some of the more salient articles in the field of child maltreatment published in 2015, with a goal of helping the general practitioner understand the evolution of research in the field of child abuse pediatrics (a board-certified specialty since 2009).
