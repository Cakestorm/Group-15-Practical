All features from the previous slide were successfully implemented into the final product - in particular, the app works well enough that we can make this presentation in it!\n\n\n\n\nWe met our commitments in the following ways:\n\n\n\n\nModularity: The JavaScript nodes allow users to modify the app however they please, using only basic knowledge of the language. In particular, it is remarkably easy to share modules: users simply copy-and-paste JavaScript files.\n\n\n\n\nLightweightedness: The app, on its own, requires just one python library to run, and is in total less than 10MB in size. Further, typing notes is remarkably easy; one only needs to type in the textbox like a WYSIWYG editor, with the notes autosaved as the user types.\n\n\n\n\nIntelligence: The ML-Based intelligent search algorithm was implemented, and support for \ufeff\nLaTeX\nL\nA\nT\nE\n\t\u200b\n\nX\ufeff is total and easy to use. Linking is a successful feature as well; it is the feature being used at the bottom of each slide!\n\n\n\n\nprevious slide | next slide", "updatedAt": 1714676863157}
